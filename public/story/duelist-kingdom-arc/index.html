<p><em>&ldquo;Yugi and his friends travel to the Duelist Kingdom island and challenge Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters, in order to recover the soul of Yugi&rsquo;s grandfather.&rdquo;</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Author&rsquo;s Note</strong>: My goal with this arc was to recreate it faithfully within the Kingdom Duels ruleset. Therefore, no actual changes were made in the narrative on this particular arc. The 40 episodes are replicated here as precisely as they were in the original japanese run of the anime.</p>

<li>A narrator explains how in Ancient Egypt, when the pyramids were young, ancient Kings played Shadow Games, which erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the world. However a Pharaoh sealed the magic away, imprisoning it in the Millennium Items. Thousands of years later Yugi Muto unlocked the secrets of the Millennium Puzzle infusing him with ancient magical energies. Destiny has chosen Yugi to prevent the return of the Shadow Games, just like the Pharaoh did.</li>
<li>At Domino High School, Yugi is teaching his friend, Jonouchi, <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---yugi-vs-jonouchi" >how</a></strong> to play Duel Monsters, while Honda, Anzu and Bakura watch.</li>
<li>Yugi takes his friends to see Sugoroku&rsquo;s (his grandfather) shop. The old man reveals that he has an ultra rare card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kaiba, a rich kid from school who overheard them talking about it, arrives to the place too and attempts to purchase the card but Yugi&rsquo;s grandfather refuses.</li>
<li>Later that night Kaiba calls Yugi asking him to come retrieve his grandfather as he is not feeling well and needs picking up. Kaiba had sent his employees to grab the old man and drag him to his place, where they dueled and he took his Blue-Eyes card.</li>
<li>Kaiba welcomes Yugi and his friends at his company and tears apart the card he took from Sugoroku. He explains that he did it because already had 3 Blue-Eyes and didn&rsquo;t wanted for the 4th one to be used against him.</li>
<li>Sugoroku leaves in an ambulance but entrust Yugi his own deck. Anzu uses a marker to draw a smiley face symbol of friendship on everyone&rsquo;s hands. She says that even though the ink will wash away, they will always remember the circle of their friendship.</li>
<li>Yugi <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---kaiba-vs-yugi" >confronts</a></strong> Kaiba in an epic duel using his grandfather&rsquo;s deck. Yugi is overwhelmed and cornered though, as Kaiba is an excellent duelist. Eventually the protagonist manages to draw the five legendary pieces of Exodia, which allow him to win the duel and cleanse the darkness in Kaiba&rsquo;s heart using the power of his Millennium Puzzle.</li>
<li>Elsewhere, Pegasus is informed that the uncontested champion Seto Kaiba has been defeated by someone named Yugi. Pegasus smiles and his golden left eye flashes.</li>

<li>At school Jonouchi is <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---jonouchi-vs-anzu" >dueling</a></strong> Anzu and is defeated by her quite easily. He still has a ton of room to improve so after a talk with Yugi he decides to ask for Sugoroku to train him into a better duelist.</li>
<li>A few days later the Duel Monster National Tournament is taking place and the group is watching the <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---haga-vs-ryuzaki" >finals</a></strong> on the TV between Insector Haga and Dinosaur Ryuzaki, a matchup that ends up with Haga&rsquo;s victory. Pegasus J. Crawford, creator of Duel Monsters, hands the trophy to Haga and announces a new tournament of a scale never seen before that will be taking place soon.</li>
<li>Yugi receives a delivery package in the form of a VHS tape, a gauntlet and some other things from Industrial Illusions, the company creating Duel Monster cards. He watches the VHS which happens to be a message from Pegasus inviting him to the tournament.</li>
<li>Suddenly everything changes when the Pegasus from the TV freezes time and lures Yugi into a Shadow Game using the power of his Millennium Eye. They have a time-gated <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---pegasus-vs-yugi" >duel</a></strong> of 15 minutes and Yugi is shocked by Pegasus abilities to read his mind. In the end Yugi is about to deliver a final blow but the time limit is up and Pegasus wins. Using his powers, he seals Sugoroku&rsquo;s soul into a card and challenges Yugi to come and recover it by defeating him face to face in the upcoming Duelist Kingdom tournament.</li>

<li>Meanwhile, Seto Kaiba arrives in a helicopter to the Duelist Kingdom island in search of Mokuba and encounters Yugi and the group.

<li>She then recalls some time ago when she was working part-time at Burger World and she feared that Yugi and Jonouchi would reveal this to the school when they visited one day (as it was against the school rules to have a part-timme job). She admitted she was working there to raise money to travel to New York to study dance, and was shocked to find they were encouraging her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a pervert mugger with a camera, and was knocked out unconscious for a moment. She was rescued by Yugi who challenged the mugger with Duel Monster cards and Mind Crushed him. Although she was a bit hazy she remembered the confident attitude of Yugi at that time.</li>

<li>In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle battlements. It&rsquo;s clear that the force of Yugi&rsquo;s next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him. Kaiba resurrects the dragon head that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi&rsquo;s monster and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move, otherwise he will fall to his death. Yugi and his other self have a conflict over risking Kaiba&rsquo;s life for his grandpa. The-other-Yugi launches the attack anyway, but Anzu runs to him pleading to call off the attack.

<li>Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is frightened of his other self, who was willing to kill in order to win. He drops to his knees and begins to sob. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi on his weakness, but Anzu tearfully scolds him, saying that he bet his &ldquo;chip of life&rdquo; like it was nothing and that he is the true loser because Yugi was willing to protect Kaiba&rsquo;s own life despite the outcome of the duel.

<li>Yugi, Jonouchi and Mai have ten Star Chips each so they enter the castle for the finals. They head onto the main balcony where they meet up with Bandit Keith, the other finalist.</li>
<li>Mr. Crocketts comes in and greets the finalists telling them there will be an exhibition match for them between Seto Kaiba and Pegasus himself. Kaiba wants Pegasus to duel with his Duel Disks but Pegasus says if they use them, the now soul-less Mokuba will operate his for him. Kaiba, not wanting to duel his own little brother, decides to <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-26-27---pegasus-vs-kaiba" >duel</a></strong> in a normal Dueling Arena instead.</li>
<li>The battle starts and Pegasus uses his power to get a clear advantage of his opponent.</li>

He unleash his powerful Toon monsters against him, and although Kaiba puts up a valiant fight, in the end he is defeated by a reverse combo in which Pegasus uses Kaiba&rsquo;s own virus card to destroy his entire deck.</li>
<li>After the duel, Pegasus seals Kaiba&rsquo;s soul inside a card. Yugi, both saddened and angry after everything that happened, challenges Pegasus. He responds that if he wish to duel him he has to win the tournament first.</li>

<li>It is the evening before the Duelist Kingdom finals and everyone in the castle is having dinner in the dining hall. During the feast, the pairings of Duelists in the Finals are determined. First, Yugi will face Mai, and then Jonouchi will duel Keith. Unfortunately, Jonouchi and Keith do not have either of the required tournament entry cards. Yugi gives his friend the &ldquo;Glory of the King&rsquo;s Hand&rdquo; entry card for him to use the prize money for his sister&rsquo;s eye operation. Meanwhile, Keith schemes to find another way to get one of the cards.</li>
<li>After the dinner, everyone splits and heads to their designated bedrooms. Mai is planning her strategy for the duel. Jonouchi is asleep in his room, dreaming and talking out loud when Keith sneaks in and steals his tournament entry card. Yugi is asleep and has a dream with his grandpa and the Kaiba brothers cards in tombstones, speaking to him asking for his help.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Honda suspects that Pegasus cheated in his duel against Kaiba and brings Anzu and Bakura to inspect the Dueling Arena. They find a hole that shines moonlight directly at the arena. Looking through the hole, Honda sees a tower on the other side of the courtyard and suspects that one of Pegasus&rsquo; henchmen may have being spying on Kaiba&rsquo;s hand using a telescope. The three climb into the tower using a grappling hook. Inside, they inspect the room and find nothing but a painting of a woman. They are soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another place.</li>
<li>The three wake up in a passageway filled with Egyptian murals and paintings. They enter a room, where two robed men are facing each other while others behind them are chanting. The two robed men reveal stone tablets to each other. One contains a carving of a &ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&rdquo; while the other has a &ldquo;Crawling Dragon&rdquo;. The robed man with &ldquo;Crawling Dragon&rdquo; loses and is consumed in green flames, as his monster was weaker than &ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&rdquo;. Honda, Anzu and Bakura unintentionally make some noice seeing this, causing the robed men to notice them and surround them. The winning man reveals himself to be Pegasus.</li>
<li>Pegasus reveals that the game he just played was one of the Shadow Games that took place in ancient Egypt, an ancient ritual where one&rsquo;s very being is put to the test. He reads Anzu and Honda&rsquo;s minds, to their shock, and explains what his Millennium Eye can do. When he tries to do the same to Bakura, his Millennium Ring appears and the evil Bakura takes over Bakura&rsquo;s body. Pegasus is absolutely surprised about this. Then, their Millennium Items clash in a powerful beam of light.</li>
<li>Honda and Anzu appear back in their rooms, feeling that what just had happened was a dream. In his own room, the other Bakura is happy that he has finally found the Millennium Eye.</li>

<li>The second duel of the semifinals between Keith and Jonouchi is about to begin. When Mr. Crocketts asks both contestants to show their tournament entry cards, Keith shows the one he took from Jonouchi. So naturally, when Jonouchi reaches for his, he can&rsquo;t find it. He has five minutes to find that card or he will be disqualified. Jonouchi searches all over his room for it, but to no avail. He is just about to give up when Mai comes in and gives him her card. He arrives at the Dueling Arena just in the nick of time and presents Mai&rsquo;s card, to Keith&rsquo;s shock.</li>
<li>The <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-31-32---keith-vs-jonouchi" >duel</a></strong> between them begins, and Keith takes the advantage with his machine monsters which are immune to magic attacks. He is far more experienced and after dealing with some of Jonouchi&rsquo;s cards he launches a final attack&hellip; which gets stopped by Jonouchi. The duel then turns into a neck-to-neck battle, proving how much Jonouchi has learned in the island.</li>

He ends up making a crazy move though, summoning his Red-Eyes Black Dragon and using Keith own cards against him. At some point Keith has to actually cheat by pulling cards to his hand in order to re-take the advantage, but even then Jonouchi manages to find a path and deal the finishing blow.</li>
<li>Keith, refusing to accept defeat, demands the Duel be declared invalid since Joey used Mai&rsquo;s card. Jonouchi admits this is true and asks how he could have known that. Pegasus, at this point declares that Keith stole Jonouchi&rsquo;s card, and that he personally doesn&rsquo;t care much about which card they are holding, but he cannot condone how he cheated during the duel. Pegasus orders his guards to take Keith away, but Keith knocks them out cold, jumps towards Pegasus, and points a gun to his head, demanding the prize money. Pegasus mocks Keith and activates a trap door on the ground, sending Keith through a tunnel and out into the ocean.</li>
<li>With Jonouchi being the winner, he now has to face Yugi in the final duel of the tournament to decide the one that will face Pegasus.</li>

<li>Afterwards, Jonouchi tries to give him his &ldquo;Glory of the King&rsquo;s Right Hand&rdquo;, but Yugi tells him to keep it since Jonouchi needs the money more than he does and Yugi is only there to rescue his grandfather.

<li>The final Duel of Duelist Kingdom is about to begin. Yugi will face Pegasus for the release of his grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba. The Big Five are watching the Duel, knowing that if Pegasus wins, Kaiba Corporation is his. Before the duel starts, Mr. Crocketts asks Yugi to show the &ldquo;Glory of the King&rsquo;s Left Hand&rdquo; card to challenge the king, which he does. He explains that if he wins he will get 60% of Industrial Illusion&rsquo;s stocks (in other words, if he wishes it, he will become the new president of Industrial Illusions). Pegasus then says that on the other hand, if Yugi loses the duel, he will be trapped in a card like the others.</li>
<li>The <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-35-39---pegasus-vs-yugi" >Duel</a></strong> does not start off very well for Yugi, as Pegasus is able to read his mind through the use of his Millennium Eye, thereby countering any of Yugi&rsquo;s moves.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Honda, believing Pegasus is up to something, runs off to the castle&rsquo;s dungeon to find the bodies of the Kaiba brothers. He wanders around the dungeon until he finds Mokuba. Unfortunately, unlocking his cell door triggered a silent alarm, forcing him to flee while the guards hunt him down.</li>

They will not even tell each other what cards they place on the field, making Pegasus unable to figure out their strategies.</li>
<li>When Yugi destroys Pegasus&rsquo; &ldquo;Toon World&rdquo; and all of his monsters, Pegasus decides to take the duel with the utmost respect and he starts a Shadow Game.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Honda and Bakura are cornered in the dungeon, but suddenly Bakura uses &ldquo;Flesh-Eating Insect&rdquo; to attack Pegasus&rsquo;s guards, then sending them to the Graveyard with &ldquo;Metamor Pot&rdquo;. Honda realizes that Bakura is really the spirit of the Millennium Ring from before, and Bakura reveals that he wants to use Mokuba&rsquo;s body for himself.

<li>Contact between them and Yugi has been cut off, and they cannot enter the shadow cloud - they either walk straight through it or return where they started.</li>
<li>Inside the shadow, the <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-35-39---pegasus-vs-yugi" >duel</a></strong> continues. The virtual simulation system from Kaiba is not working. Instead, each monster is maintained by one&rsquo;s life energy, and regular Yugi cannot handle the force of the Shadow Game. The-other-Yugi takes over for a time stating that Yugi will not survive in such conditions, but Yugi convinces him to switch back to keep their Mind Shuffle strategy working. He manages to draw and set a card, but when Pegasus destroy&rsquo;s his defending monster Yugi collapses. Despite his other self frantic calls, Yugi seems to be gone. This leaves just the-other-Yugi against Pegasus, who can once again read his mind and know all of his moves.</li>

When Pegasus tries to read Yugi&rsquo;s mind, the card he drew is blocked because of Anzu, Honda and Jonouchi spiritually bonding together to support Yugi.</li>
<li>In a final epic turn, the-other-Yugi <strong><a class="link" href="/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-35-39---pegasus-vs-yugi" >wins</a></strong> with the help of &ldquo;Magician of Black Chaos&rdquo;, a card summoned thanks to the final effort of Yugi himself. Pegasus is left completely shocked at his loss, as the shadow bubble dissipates.</li>
<li>Yugi&rsquo;s friends are overjoyed that he is okay and that he finally won the duel, but Anzu quickly reminds everyone that this is not over yet until Pegasus returns Kaiba, Mokuba, and Yugi&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s souls like he promised. Yugi then turns around and is shocked to see that Pegasus has disappeared. Bakura at this point wakes up and calls out to the group. Honda reveals to Bakura that he had to get rid of the Millennium Ring as it was possessing him like before and Bakura thanks him, understanding that getting rid of it was the probably the right thing to do. Bakura then tells the group he&rsquo;ll keep an eye on Mokuba while the others search for Pegasus.</li>
<li>After they leave, the Millennium Ring reappears around his neck and the evil Bakura returns. Mokuba&rsquo;s body is no longer of use to Bakura since Pegasus will be returning his soul, but with Pegasus weakened, Yami Bakura states it is the perfect time to take his Millennium Eye.</li>

<li>Having won the tournament, Yugi is now officially the King of Duelists.</li>
<li>Yugi and his friends are running through the castle in order to find Pegasus, so that he will release all the souls that he captured like he promised. Anzu stops for a brief moment because she notices a nearby tower. She notes to her friends that she recognizes that tower as the one she thought that Honda and Bakura went up into before in a dream. She then realizes that was Pegasus&rsquo;s sanctuary and what she remembered was real. Honda agrees too as the memory is coming back to him. They decide to go there.</li>
<li>Pegasus is in his private tower and is depressed that he lost against Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle. Regardless, he is a man of his word, so he releases the souls of Sugoroku and the Kaiba brothers. Because of this all 3 wake up and regain their senses. Just then, the evil Bakura arrives and gives Pegasus an impromptu tarot reading before challenging him to a Shadow Game using their Millennium Items. Bakura easily defeats Pegasus (who&rsquo;s still exhausted from his Shadow Game with Yugi), and takes his Millennium Eye. Yugi and the gang arrive to see Pegasus unconscious being carried away by his guards. They enter the tower and find Pegasus&rsquo;s diary. Anzu reads from it, and it explains that as a teenager, he met a girl named Cyndia. They were true lovers, but just as they were about to be married, Cyndia got sick and died.</li>
<li>Pegasus traveled all over the world trying to get her back. He wound up in Egypt, where he met a man named Shadi, who gave him the Millennium Eye. Thanks to his wish asked to the Eye he got a brief vision of her. Pegasus gets the idea that using the holographic technology of Kaiba Corporation along with the power of the Millennium Items could bring Cyndia back to life. He explains in his diary that this was his reason for hosting the Duelist Kingdom tournament, but the diary ends there.</li>
<li>Yugi notices that there are three Soul Prison cards that are blank. That means Pegasus did release the souls of his prisoners like he had promised. As the group leaves, Shadi appears in the stairs using magic and confronts Yugi. Shadi uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi&rsquo;s mind, as that is the power of his item. To his surprise, he finds two chambers in his mind, one for Yugi, and the other for the-other-Yugi. While the former is a nice room full of innocence and toys, the latter is a giant maze filled with trap doors. Shadi enters through several of them before almost falling into an endless void. Luckily, the regular Yugi saves him.</li>
<li>In one of the chambers, Shadi and Yugi are walking alongside stone tablets that feature monsters from the actual Duel Monsters game. The &ldquo;Dark Magician&rdquo; shows up, who is about to attack them as he thinks they are intruders. Shadi plans to use the &ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&rdquo; tablet below them to destroy it, but Yugi talks him out and manages to convince the &ldquo;Dark Magician&rdquo; to let him go. Shadi is shocked that Yugi was able to convince the &ldquo;Dark Magician&rdquo; that easily, given that the &ldquo;Dark Magician&rdquo; is it said to be the most loyal of the ancient Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants. Shadi leaves Yugi&rsquo;s mind, believing he is the one that will save the world from chaos. Before he leaves, Shadi warns Yugi to take great care as the thief that stole the Millennium Eye will go after Yugi&rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle soon.</li>
