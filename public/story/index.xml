&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A new tournament arises: Battle City. Organized by Seto Kaiba, it gathers elite Duelists from all over Japan and introduces impressive new technology that would turn Domino City itself into a battleground. As Yugi enters the competition, he must face powerful foes and dark powers, all while uncovering secrets about the ancient Millennium Items and the mysterious Egyptian God Cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My main goal here was to properly adapt the beloved Battle City arc to the Kingdom Duels ruleset, trying to preserve as much as possible from the original duels while also taking advantage of the fact that the Virtual World arc was moved ahead in the timeline so both the Battle City and the Battle City Finals can take place in a single arc as it should have been in the original anime release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Battle City tournament is less than a week away. Jonouchi learns about the tournament from Yugi and Anzu, and decides to join in to help Yugi, despite their warning about Kaiba having a grudge against him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the registration office, Yugi is well-qualified to enter the tournament, but when Jonouchi tries to sign up, he finds out his ranking is too low. However, the clerk notices Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Rarest Card is the &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo;, something the Ghouls (Rare Hunters) would like to get their hands on. The clerk then secretly changes Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s ranking so that it is high enough and tells him he is qualified, that Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;incorrect&amp;rdquo; ranking was due to a computer glitch. The clerk then issues Yugi and Jonouchi their Duel Disks, and although they had used a prototype of them before in the virtual world, these are the real deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortly after Yugi and his friends leave, the shop clerk calls the Ghouls to tell them that he found a nice catch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That evening, Jonouchi splits from everyone else to go to the hospital to visit Shizuka, who is about to get her eye operation. He is confronted by three Ghouls. One of them forces him into a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. The Rare Hunter tells him that if he loses, he must give up his &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo;. During the duel, the opponent plays defensively until he draws all five pieces of &amp;ldquo;Exodia&amp;rdquo; and wins. The group of Ghouls then beat Jonouchi up and take his Red-Eyes as per the stakes of the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next morning, Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s mother calls Yugi, saying that he never showed up at the hospital. Yugi, Honda, and Anzu search for him. Honda, riding his motorcycle, finds him at a beach. After some words and blows are exchanged between the two, Honda takes Jonouchi to the hospital. Apparently after getting beat-up, Jonouchi was angry of having lost his Card and thought he couldn&amp;rsquo;t face his younger sister.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He helps Shizuka get the confidence she needs to go through with her operation. Jonouchi is determined to get his &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo; back from the Ghouls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire city is filled with duelists to the surprise of ordinary people. Yugi wonders what is the meaning of the puzzle card that came up with his Duel Disk. He bumps into Mai, Haga, Ryuzaki and Kajiki before splitting up, as each will try to find a location that would benefit their own decks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba announces the start of the Battle City, detailing the rules and stating that the finals will be in a hidden place. To find where it is there the participants need to get 6 puzzle cards. There are 48 participants in the tournament, all ranked on level 5 or higher, so only 8 duelists can reach the finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Jonouchi start moving around as everybody else does. Jonouchi spots the Rare Hunter who took his &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo; and challenges him to an ante Duel so that he will be able to win it back. The Rare Hunter refuses to Duel him, but wants to duel Yugi to get his &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi agrees to the battle on the condition that should he win, the Rare Hunter should hand back Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo;. As the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; starts, Jonouchi tries to tell Yugi about the Rare Hunter&amp;rsquo;s strategy, but Yugi tells him not to say so, as it would be unfair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s control center, Kaiba and Mokuba watch the very first duel taking place. Kaiba is informed that Yugi&amp;rsquo;s opponent is one of the Ghouls who had hacked themselves into the Kaiba Corporation mainframe to enlist themselves as participants. Hearing this, Mokuba tries to go and stop the duel and disqualify him, but Kaiba refrains him from doing so, as he wants the other Egyptian God Cards from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the duel, Yugi deduces the Rare Hunter&amp;rsquo;s strategy to summon &amp;ldquo;Exodia&amp;rdquo; and devises a strategy of his own to counter it. After winning the Duel he takes &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo; and destroys the Rare Hunter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Exodia&amp;rdquo; cards after realizing they were all counterfeit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point the Rare Hunter posture and demeanor changes: he is being controlled from afar with the power of the Millennium Rod. Yugi is greeted by the man doing the possession, named Marik, who addresses him as &amp;ldquo;Pharaoh&amp;rdquo; and declares that the Pharaoh will be destroyed with the help of one of his Egyptian God Cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Yugi tries to return &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes&amp;rdquo; to Jonouchi, he refuses, saying Yugi won &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes&amp;rdquo; fair and square. Jonouchi intends to use the Battle City tournament as a chance to strengthen and improve himself and become a &amp;ldquo;True Duelist&amp;rdquo; like Yugi himself. When the time comes, he plans to challenge Yugi to a friendly duel in an attempt to win &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes&amp;rdquo; from his friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They shake hands and depart in opposite directions just when Anzu was finally arriving to the place they were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During his patroll, Mokuba spots the kid who had the star chips that he stole back in duelist kingdom. He apologizes profusely to him about what happened and wishes him the best of luck during the tournament. The kid accept his apologize and even gifts him a few of his own cards. They depart in amicable terms, and Mokuba relieved about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to find a worthy opponent to duel, Jonouchi arrives just in time to watch Esper Roba (a duelist claiming to have psychic powers) &lt;strong&gt;defeat&lt;/strong&gt; Dinosaur Ryuzaki. As per the Battle City Rules, Ryuzaki had to give up his &amp;ldquo;Serpent Night Dragon&amp;rdquo; to Roba as it was his rarest card. Roba, knowing Jonouchi was the runner-up in Duelist Kingdom, challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; and he accepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in the hospital, Honda visits Shizuka and brings a laptop with him, so he can watch the Duel online and tell her how her brother is doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Duel does not start off very well for Jonouchi, as he is intimidated by Roba&amp;rsquo;s psychic powers. Yugi is watching the Duel from a rooftop and sees Roba&amp;rsquo;s brothers spying on Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s cards, revealing that Roba is actually cheating. Yugi decides to just watch and let the Duel take its course. Eventually, Jonouchi figures that he is being watched from somewhere above them. Roba&amp;rsquo;s brothers realize they&amp;rsquo;re busted for sure. Yugi congratulates Jonouchi on his efforts as he is now in control of the Duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba finds out about the cheating, dashes in and tackles the wicked accomplices up on the roof. He threatens to expel Roba from Battle City, but the brothers talk him out of it after telling him their story: they are orphans and have no one but Roba to protect and care for them. Mokuba, having been in a similar situation, is convinced to let the Duel continue as long as they stop cheating. His decision is also influenced from seeing Yugi watching the duel from a different roof during his conversation and thinking that Yugi would give them a second chance as well. He stands by to be sure they don&amp;rsquo;t start doing it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Anzu, who can&amp;rsquo;t find Yugi or Jonouchi, is sitting in a bench in the park and ponders about the past of the other Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the hospital, Honda lies to Shizuka about the Duel, saying that Jonouchi is winning when in fact, he is not. When a nurse comes in to examine Shizuka, Honda leaves the room and decides to call Anzu, who is now with with Sugoroku at the park. Honda asks Anzu to send a message to Jonouchi. He then returns to Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s room, who now knows the real status of the duel: she asked the nurse to look at the laptop and tell her what was going on while Honda was out. Honda apologizes for lying to Shizuka and the two start cheering for Jonouchi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The duel is reaching its conclusion. Jonouchi doesn&amp;rsquo;t look too good, but Anzu and Sugoroku arrive and tell him that Honda called from the hospital to say that he and Shizuka are watching the duel online. Anzu says they all believe in him, encouraging Jonouchi to fight on, which gives him enough motivation to win the duel. Esper Roba is acting like a sore loser, worried about his brothers, but just then the Roba brothers arrive and they tell him how proud they are of him for doing his best and almost winning, even without cheating. Esper stands up and gives his brothers a hug, then he hands over his &amp;ldquo;Psycho Shocker&amp;rdquo; and Puzzle Card to Jonouchi and promises he will not cheat again. Jonouchi accepts it and walks off with Anzu and Sugoroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A duelist, Koji Nagumo, was unhappy with the card he won through the ante rule after one of his Duels. He was demanding that his opponent also gave him his second rarest card. At that moment Mokuba and Kaiba show up. Kaiba challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, and defeats him (offscreen) with the power of his God Card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik now knows where the god Obelisk is after Kaiba used it. He remembers how he stole the other two Egyptian God cards in Egypt and threatened Ishizu for the final one. He figures that the whole tournament was most likely planned by her, and that he should be wary of her machinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After encouraging him in his next duels, Anzu and Sugoroku split up from Jonouchi and go searching for Yugi once again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi is told to enter a circus tent by a harlequin whose &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; is wating inside. Anzu and Sugoroku manage to see him in the distance and follow him, but lose track when he enters that place. Yugi then enters a real life Mystic Box and disappears into an underground chamber, which blocks the transmission of his Duel Disk to the Kaiba Corporation building. There, he meets Pandora, a Rare Hunter who also has a &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; in his deck. He challenges Yugi to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Duelists have their ankles locked so they cannot escape. As they lose life points, a buzzsaw will approach them and slice off their legs if they lose. A box holding a key will open for the winner. In the meantime, Mokuba (who was tasked by Kaiba to investigate Yugi&amp;rsquo;s dissapearance from the grid) meet up with Anzu and Sugoroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the duel Yugi summons &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician Girl&amp;rdquo; for the first time, turning the tables and beating his opponent with the power of the magicians. Pandora tries to use a hidden key to break himself out. However, Marik plays tricks on his mind using his Millennium Rod so he cannot see or feel the key he already has on his hand. Yugi breaks himself and manages to free Pandora out of his locks, saving his legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik speaks to Yugi through Pandora and tells him of how he was the one who controlled Keith, and of his own motives and plans. He is part of a family of Tomb Keepers who has been protecting the legacy of the pharaoh for 3000 years, isolated from the rest of the world. Marik is the heir to that clan, and wants to become &amp;ldquo;new Pharaoh&amp;rdquo; himself by collecting all three god cards. He wants to be freed from that terrible destiny and put an end to the tradition of his clan due to the suffering and pain they have endured for generations. And to do that, he must kill &amp;ldquo;the other Yugi&amp;rdquo; and collect all three god cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just afterwards, Anzu, Sugoroku, Mokuba and Honda (who bumped into them a few moments ago) find Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the morning of the second day of Battle City. At Yugi&amp;rsquo;s house, Anzu and Honda arrive and meet Sugoroku but he tells them that Yugi has already gone to the city. Anzu blames Honda for being late. Meanwhile, Jonouchi bumps into Mai and Yugi in the main square. Mai has already 4 puzzle cards and Yugi has 3, so Jonouchi is feeling a bit behind with only 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi then goes searching for another opponent. At one point he is just standing around when he is addressed by a kid who wants his autograph. The kid asks him to hold his Duel Disk and runs away when Jonouchi is distracted bragging. Jonouchi chases him, but the kid is stopped by Honda, who was with Anzu and Sugoroku and had noticed the chase. The four of them question the kid, and he confesses he wanted to become a strong Duelist, but all of his cards were stolen. When pressed for a description of the thief, he describes Insector Haga, and Jonouchi immediately runs off to find Haga for a little payback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once everyone is gone, the kid smirks and sneaks off to an alley. Haga is waiting there, and the kid reports that he did everything as planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, a kid helps Shizuka watch the duel in the hospital by narrating everything that happens from the laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a different place, Ryuzaki is bitter that he lost too quickly and would try to requalify by beating some duelist by betting cards, but would then find out it was useless as the system already rejected him, making him drop entirely from the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still searching, Jonouchi catches sight of Haga and challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of them have two puzzle cards, and they wager both of them on the Duel. It becomes clear right away that Haga hasn&amp;rsquo;t lost his taste for Insect-swarming strategies, but Jonouchi puts up a good fight. At one point Haga manages to summon &amp;ldquo;Parasite Paracide&amp;rdquo; from Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Deck, and this is met with disgust and consternation from Jonouchi and the others, as Jonouchi doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep any Insect-Type monsters in his deck. They quickly realize that the kid from earlier put the parasite card in Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Deck under Haga&amp;rsquo;s orders when he briefly took Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Duel Disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The situation gets worse when Haga makes it clear that he is planning to Summon an ace monster to surpass the &amp;ldquo;Great Moth&amp;rdquo; he Summoned in Duelist Kingdom. In the end, Jonouchi manages to find a way out of the insect&amp;rsquo;s trap using his &amp;ldquo;Gearfried&amp;rdquo; card and wins the duel, giving another step towards his goal of becoming a &amp;ldquo;True Duelist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quiet One, a mime completely controlled by Marik and devoid of personality, runs around the city until he finds Yugi near the river, challenging him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. By using a powerful combo, he puts Yugi in a really tight situation which gets even worse when he summons his God Card: The Sky Dragon of Osiris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, his friends are waiting for Jonouchi to pick an opponent. He is decided on keep challenging only stronger opponents than him so he can grow and become a true duelist. At that point Kaiba shows up, confused about why is Jonouchi dueling in his tournament. Jonouchi recklessly challenges him and he accepts, but at that moment a Kaiba Corporation helicopter shows up, telling Kaiba that the second God Card has appeared. Kaiba leaves, telling Jonouchi that he was lucky this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The god card seems invincible and Yugi is on the brink of defeat. Kaiba shows up to watch the duel between Yugi and his Ghoul opponent, and demands that he stand up after seeing him drop to his knees. In the end, Yugi manages to find the out and pulls off an incredible move to turn the tides and win the duel in an unexpected way. With his victory, he now is the owner of Osiris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba then demands a duel to see who gets to keep Osiris, but Marik briefly regains control of the Quiet One to tell Yugi that he is on his way to Battle City and that he is now going to target Yugi&amp;rsquo;s own friends to turn them into his mind slaves and get what he wants. Yugi calls off his duel with Kaiba for the moment, so he can find his friends before Marik.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi is in a rush searching for his friends, and Kaiba decides to help him on the promise that Yugi will duel him after they make sure they&amp;rsquo;re safe. They are then stopped by two Rare Hunters who challenge them to a &lt;strong&gt;tag duel&lt;/strong&gt; in which Kaiba displays the oppressive power of his God Card Obelisk for an overwhelming win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Jonouchi and his friends encounter Bakura on the streets and go to the aquarium where they find Kajiki. Bakura splits from them and meet Marik, after being alerted of his presence due to his Millennium Ring. Marik gets off his bike and the two of them initially test each other&amp;rsquo;s Millennium powers. They then make a deal to work together to achieve their respective goals: Bakura will help Marik get the God Cards in exchange for his Millennium Rod.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back at the aquarium, Jonouchi and Kajiki &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; each other in a back and forth duel that concludes in Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s victory. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to take the &amp;ldquo;Legendary Fisherman&amp;rdquo; card that means so much to Kajiki, but he insists, telling him that he earned it and that he needs to give up that card to be able to grow independently. Jonouchi now has 6 puzzle cards and has virtually qualified to the finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, Shizuka calls Jonouchi and congratulates him. She says that she&amp;rsquo;ll soon be able to take off the bandages and that the first thing she wants to see is him dueling. Honda departs to bring her there. As he leaves, they see a man asking for help while holding an injured Bakura. The man introduces himself as Namu (but in reality is Marik) and says that he found it like this in the street. Sugoroku takes Bakura to the hospital. A group of Rare Hunters surrounds Anzu, Jonouchi and Namu and beat them up, taking them hostages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mokuba goes back to the heartquarters to search for Jonouchi given that Kaiba and Yugi couldn&amp;rsquo;t find them in the Aquarium. On his way there, Mokuba is captured by some Ghouls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Masked Duelists show up and challenge Yugi and Kaiba to a &lt;strong&gt;tag duel&lt;/strong&gt; of great risk on top of a skyscraper, while mocking Kaiba after they kidnapped Mokuba. In that duel, when a player&amp;rsquo;s LP reach 0, the glass floor under him will break, plunging that duelist to his death. Kaiba and Yugi fail at first to work with synergy and make mistakes that almost cost them the duel, but eventually they get to actually work together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the duel is taking place, Mokuba manages to escape captivity with the help of Anzu, who asks for him to get help. Meanwhile Rishid steps on to where Jonouchi is being held tied to a chair and extends his hand towards him. Marik, who is behind Jonouchi completely unseen, takes control of his mind with his Millennium Rod, making it look like Rishid was the one to do it. Afterwards they repeat this process with Anzu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Kaiba and Yugi defeat one of the Masked Duelists and they win the duel, Marik takes control of the other one and reveals that he has managed to completely brainwash both Jonouchi and Anzu with the power of his Millennium Rod, and that he&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting to see them soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba takes the final puzzle cards from the defeated so both Yugi and him have 6 now. A helicopter from Kaiba Corporation shows up to pick them up, and Kaiba receives a call from his brother who tells them what happened with him. Mokuba tells them to meet him in Domino&amp;rsquo;s Port, the location where Yugi&amp;rsquo;s friends are being held hostage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There are duels happening all over Domino City as the tournament progress. Shizuka and Honda are on the train going to the city. Meanwhile, in the helicopter, Kaiba and Yugi are talking about Marik and the Millennium Items. While Kaiba refuses to believe in that &amp;ldquo;occult nonsense&amp;rdquo; (even though he has experienced the power of Pegasus&amp;rsquo; and Ishizu&amp;rsquo;s items before). The Other Yugi then tells him about himself, about how his true identity is the soul of a Pharaoh trapped in the Millennium Puzzle. Kaiba is surprised by this revelation and recalls his conversation with Ishizu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rishid has acquired 12 puzzle cards on his own as requested by Marik, for the next stage of their plan. Then, Rishid gives Jonouchi some new powerful and banned cards to add to his deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Kaiba reach the port and are greeted by the mind-controlled Jonouchi, who guides them to their dueling platform. The mind-controlled Anzu also shows up and toss Mokuba towards them, a bit beaten up. She defeated him in a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; moments before they arrived, after finding his hiding spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu then straps herself to a special metal chair and explains the rules of the duel: Yugi and Jonouchi will be chained to an anchor that hangs above the dueling site. When a player&amp;rsquo;s Life Points reach 0, his opponent&amp;rsquo;s key will be unlocked, allowing him to remove the chains. The loser is dragged into the sea forever. If the 40-minute time limit expires, the anchor is released anyway, and both duelists are drowned. Kaiba and Mokuba try to stop the duel but Marik reveal the final part of his plan: if anyone attempts to stop the Duel, a Rare Hunter controlling a crane will drop a shipping container on top of Anzu, killing her in an instant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik then forces Yugi to cast aside Osiris, keeping it from being lost in the water and also preventing him to use it. Osiris wasn&amp;rsquo;t in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s deck as he had no intention of using it during the duel as it was too dangerous, but he takes the opportunity to include Red-Eyes in his deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the rules have been explained, Marik releases Anzu from his mind-control to make her watch the duel too. She is surprised about what is happening and asks Kaiba to stop it, but he can&amp;rsquo;t do it or her life will be at risk. At the same time these events occur, Marik learns of Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s sister, Shizuka arriving in Domino City, so he instructs Rishid and his Rare Hunters to go capture her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two friends then &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; eachother. Jonouchi uses his powerful and banned cards to take an immediate advantage. At one point, Yugi takes over The Other Yugi during the duel, much to Marik&amp;rsquo;s anger (he wants to see the Pharaoh suffer, not his vessel). As he is reminded of his former self, Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s consciousness begins to shake from Marik&amp;rsquo;s control. He refuses to take &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&amp;rdquo; by the effect of &amp;ldquo;Exchange&amp;rdquo;, remembering that he promised to become a worthy duelist before taking back &amp;ldquo;Red-Eyes&amp;rdquo;. Yugi reminds Jonouchi of his promises to himself, to the Other Yugi, and to Shizuka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda and Shizuka escape from the Rare Hunters with the help of Otogi. They bump into Mai who was on a car and she drives them away. They go to the Port after getting the information from the Rare Hunters, in where they see the conclusion of the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi has finally managed to break free from Marik&amp;rsquo;s control due to the power of his bond with Yugi, but there is barely any time left. Yugi, not wanting to see Jonouchi die, decides to lose the match on purpose. Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s key box opens. But Jonouchi is unwilling to let his friend sacrifice himself this way, so he uses the same effect to force the duel to end in a draw. Yugi&amp;rsquo;s key box also opens, but he is barely conscious due to the banned card&amp;rsquo;s direct attacking effects which have taken a toll on his body. Jonouchi jumps over the platform to save him just as the time ticks down and the anchor drops. Shizuka takes off her bandage and the first thing she sees is his brother in a duel, jumping and trying to save a friend. She dives into the harbor with Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s key to free him after Jonouchi frees Yugi with the latter&amp;rsquo;s key. At the same time, Kaiba knocks out the Rare Hunter operating the crane by throwing a card at him, and uses a remote control to ram his helicopter into the hanging crate, knocking it away from Anzu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the Duel, the Other Yugi&amp;rsquo;s spirit is invisibly standing behind Yugi and the gang, thinking to himself that Yugi has taught him a lesson about the power of friendship and that Yugi will one day surpass him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Marik&amp;rsquo;s attempt to defeat Yugi by mind-controlling his friends backfired, he sets his sights on defeating the Pharaoh at the Battle City Finals. He has implanted a part of himself in Bakura, and once in there Marik convinces the evil Bakura to also enter the Battle City Finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The evil Bakura takes over his vessel and stands up. He is in the hospital and Sugoroku is with him. He knocks Sugoroku out using the power of his ring and leaves the place. He steals a Duel Disk and puzzle card from a random duelist and heads to a graveyard, following a rumor that there were Duels being held there. He finds Kotsuzuka, Takaido and Satake dressed in halloween costumes, terrorizing random duelists in order to obtain puzzle cards without even dueling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though they&amp;rsquo;d already obtained five cards this way, Bakura is not impressed and challenges the three of them to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in the Shadow Realm. Not knowing any better, they accept. By losing the duel, all three are sent to hell. Bakura obtains his sixth Puzzle Card, qualifying for the Battle City finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Yugi and Jonouchi have both qualified for the Battle City Finals by having 6 puzzle cards each. By putting the Puzzle Cards on the Duel Disk they receive instructions to go to an unfinished stadium which would be the location of the finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group are close to the location of the finals when they are stopped by a hollywood star: Jean-Claude Magnum, who declares his love for Mai and ends up &lt;strong&gt;dueling her&lt;/strong&gt;, saying that if he wins they will marry, and she says that if she wins he will leave her alone once and for all. He has five puzzle cards, so he has apparently proven himself in this Battle City tournament. She, however, defeats him with ease. But unwilling to take a &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; for an answer, he has a stuntman and tries to kidnap her, but it fails and Jonouchi saves her from a big fall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group then goes to the place for the finals, Domino Stadium, a place under construction where Kaiba is waiting for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnum, defeated, decides to forget about her and dueling in general and leaves the place, leaving his duel disk behind. A masked female figure picks up the disk shortly after and takes the five puzzle cards out of it, adding another that she had in her pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Yugi, Jonouchi and Mai arrive to the arena and are qualified for the finals, Marik arrives too under the disguise of Namu. Jonouchi is a bit suspicious about his true motives, and Marik notices it so he briefly take control of Anzu&amp;rsquo;s mind to divert the attention. Jonouchi eventually dismiss his suspicious. Bakura (still injured) arrives and announces he is also a finalist, baffling everyone. Rishid comes in at this point, identifying himself as Marik, another finalist, which drives strong reactions from Yugi, Kaiba and Jonouchi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba introduces the airship (a blimp) where the finals will take place. The airship lands and all the contestants enter, although Yugi&amp;rsquo;s friends are initially not allowed as they are not finalists but Mokuba persuades Kaiba to let them on. Kaiba orders the airship to leave, even though the last finalist has not arrived, and his staff is unsure about what to do, but at the very last moment Ishizu Ishtar arrives as the 8th duelist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The finalists spend time alone in their designated rooms, except for Jonouchi who is with Shizuka and later Honda, Anzu and Otogi, who do not have their own rooms. Yugi plans his deck while talking to the Other Yugi, and says that he is worried about two things: Bakura (they agree that Bakura is most-likely once again under the influence of the Millennium Ring) and the 8th duelist (that no one knows who is it). Then, the finalists are called to the main hall to decide who will duel first that night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi (number 3) and Bakura (number 6) are randomly selected as the first two Duelists and the Aerial Dueling Arena is revealed to be the location of the quarterfinals. The other passengers and duelists watch on the sidelines. Yugi suspects that Bakura is actually the evil Bakura and once they reach the arena he demands that he reveal himself, which Bakura does so accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in the sky in a really back and forth battle that has Bakura corner Yugi with his powerful spell and trap cards, and it ends up with Yugi finally summoning Osiris to turn the tides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the last moment, Bakura is about to lose but Rishid steps up in his disguise of Marik and claims that he is actually in control of Bakura. The other personality of Bakura is confused, but the real Marik tells him to release Bakura, as it is the only way for him to win. The Other Bakura does so and the normal Bakura takes over the duel. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where he is and is still injured so he drops to his knees. He asks Yugi for help but Yugi will be disqualified if he approaches him. Yugi&amp;rsquo;s only options are to surrender the duel to help Bakura, or attack with Osiris which could do further harm his opponent. At the last moment The Other Bakura decides he cannot risk Bakura dying or being seriously harmed because he needs Bakura as a host to stay alive, so he takes over from Bakura and lets Yugi win the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duel ends, the Other Bakura lets Bakura take over again, and he is taken to his room completely unconscious. The group leave to ask Kaiba to land the airship so they can take Bakura to the hospital, and Anzu says she will stay there to look after Bakura in the meantime. At that point, Marik takes control of Anzu and takes away the Millennium Ring from him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and his friends ask Kaiba to land the airship so they can take Bakura to a hospital. Kaiba refuses, but he calls a medical team to take care of Bakura on the ship. Honda leaves to look for the missing Millennium Ring on the dueling platform, dragging Otogi along. Up there they get into a bit of a fight over Shizuka, and they trip and almost fall over but are saved by Shadi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moments later, in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s room, while adjusting his Deck, he notices Shadi&amp;rsquo;s reflection in the window. Shadi apologizes for their last encounter, saying that he had to be sure that Yugi had the strength to face what will be coming next. Yugi tells Shadi that he knows the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle is really the spirit of the Pharaoh. Shadi confirms this, and tells Yugi that all seven of the Millennium Items are onboard the ship along with all three Egyptian God cards and that the conditions are right to unlock the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s memory. But warns him that the items and the god cards can only be used by those chosen to wield them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then tells him about Pegasus&amp;rsquo; journey to Egypt. Pegasus was trying to find a way to bring back his lover to life, and ended up discovering carvings of monsters, including the Egyptian Gods thanks to Shadi&amp;rsquo;s help, which later became the inspiration for the game Duel Monsters. However, following his discovery and launching card production, Pegasus learned that nearly everyone involved with the production of the God Cards had begun to die under mysterious circumstances. Among them was a photographer who fell from the window of his hotel&amp;rsquo;s room after seeing an apparition of Obelisk, having incurred the wrath of the Gods themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of his team was too afraid to continue working on the project. Pegasus refused to stop making the cards, deciding to take onto the task himself as a challenge to the Gods. On the night after he finished painting the cards&amp;rsquo; design, his Millennium Eye showed him a vision of ancient Egypt in his sleep, where the world was being destroyed by the Gods he had painted. At this point, Shadi appeared to Pegasus. He told him the monsters were real and that Pegasus could not control both the darkness and the Gods at the same time; the solution was to seal the God Cards back in Egypt for they were too powerful. Pegasus, having experienced the Gods&amp;rsquo; power himself, took the completed cards and gave them to Ishizu Ishtar to be sealed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the present, the Other Yugi shows up and Shadi drops to one knee in a sign of respect, telling him that all he needs to do to awaken his memory is to win the tournament. He then vanish as the participants are being called for the second match of the finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadi then briefly goes to Ishizu&amp;rsquo;s room. She was thinking about his brother being a happy young boy, and tells Shadi that a horrible fate is awaiting Marik and that she joined the tournament to stop it. He tells her that the duty of the Tomb Keepers is coming to an end, one way or another. She asks him if he would relinquish his items to the Pharaoh, as he will need them to fulfil his fate, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer and just vanish again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, Shadi appears invisible behind Anzu in Bakura&amp;rsquo;s room and sees her with the Millennium Ring in her hands. He stares with anger towards the unconscious Bakura and then vanish one last time, leaving the airship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through random selection, the next duel will have Jonouchi (number 2) face off against Rishid (number 7) whom everybody still believes is Marik. Before the duel begins, Rishid shows off his Millennium Rod to help keep up his disguise (but it is actually just a replica of the original).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; progress, Rishid displays excellent dueling and controls the pace with ease. At one point, Jonouchi almost forfeits but a talk from Mai and Shizuka boost his confidence. Later, Rishid draws the egyptian god card to his own shock and confusion. Marik had slipped it in his deck to help him pretend that he is actually himself. Marik instructs Rishid to play the card but he fears that the card is too powerful and that he is not worthy enough of it. He tells him that is actually just one of many fake copies made by the Rare Hunters. The Rare Hunters could not use them because they had no connection to the ancient scriptures, but Marik believes Rishid will be able to. Rishid decides he doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to use the card to win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a flashback we learn about Rishid being abandoned as an infant in Egypt and taken in by a woman. As a child, Rishid found out from his adoptive father, Mr. Ishtar, that the family needed an heir to carry on the legacy of the Tomb Keepers. Mrs. Ishtar suggested Rishid, but Mr. Ishtar insisted it could only be their biological child; however, he reluctantly agreed when Mrs. Ishtar stated that it was fate that brought Rishid to them. When Ishizu was born, Mr. Ishtar was disappointed she was a girl and he wanted to try again for a boy. Mrs. Ishtar suggested to Rishid that he become the Tomb Keeper. Rishid was pleased about this because he would then truly be part of the Ishtar family. Later on, Marik was born and he replaced Rishid as the heir. Mrs. Ishtar died shortly after giving birth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Marik was a child, he became ill after he was bitten by a cobra. Mr. Ishtar was furious and blamed Rishid, but Marik still loved Rishid as his brother. Shortly before his Tomb Keeper&amp;rsquo;s initiation, Marik was upset that he would have to live underground his whole life. Rishid offered to take Marik&amp;rsquo;s place but Mr. Ishtar refused. After Marik&amp;rsquo;s initiation, where he was marked with the scriptures, Rishid marked his own face to prove his loyalty. Rishid also noticed a change in Marik&amp;rsquo;s behaviour after that date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the duel, Jonouchi announces that he believes Rishid isn&amp;rsquo;t really Marik since Rishid is dueling fairly while Marik has always been sneaky and manipulative. Yugi agrees and starts being suspicious of the other participants: it could be Namu, or it could be the 8th duelist. Kaiba is surprised by this declaration but doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, he must be Marik. Although Rishid is about to win, Marik tells him to instead use The God Card, as it is his last chance to convince everyone he is the real Marik. He convinces him by saying that by playing it he will truly be a part of the Ishtar family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rishid summons the counterfeit god card, but the real god becomes enraged and creates a thunderstorm. Rishid feels like a failure and is struck by lightning. His fake Millennium Rod shatters, confirming to Yugi he isn&amp;rsquo;t really Marik. Jonouchi is also struck by lightning. Since both duelists are unconscious with the same amount of Life Points, Kaiba declares that the winner will be the first one to get back on his feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi has a dream where all his friends give him encouragement. This helps him stand up and win the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rishid tells Jonouchi who the real Marik is and falls unconscious. Namu (Marik) confirms this against his will, as the Evil Marik takes over his body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group is in Rishid&amp;rsquo;s room, and he is unconscious. They still don&amp;rsquo;t know his name. Before the next duel is decided, Jonouchi brings up the dream he had about all his friends when he was knocked out in his duel against Rishid. Mai asks him if she was in this dream but out of embarrassment, he lies and says she was not. Mai interprets this as Jonouchi not caring about her, and steels her heart about dueling and friendship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi takes a few minutes and goes to the room of the 8th duelist, speaking through the door and saying that he knows her identity. Ishizu lets him in. Yugi explains that Shadi showed up before the duel and mentioned that all the Millennium Items are in the ship, therefore he guessed she was the last one. She confirms it, and asks him what does he know about Shadi. They talk for a bit and she reveals what happened in the Museum just a few days ago, and her encounter with the evil Bakura. She tells him that Bakura took Pegasus&amp;rsquo; eye back in Duelist Kingdom, and also tells him that Shadi is actually dead, much to Yugi&amp;rsquo;s surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point the announcer says that the next duel is about to be defined. Yugi leaves to go there, but Ishizu refuses to go with him, simply saying that she knows she&amp;rsquo;ll duel in the last duel, and that she needs to remain hidden until then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next duel is Mai (number 4) against Marik (number 5) who is now his evil persona. Marik, who brainwashed a doctor to get the key to Rishid&amp;rsquo;s room, is about to kill him when he hears his name called out to the duel, so he leaves for now to deal with that and later deal with Rishid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; is an evil spectacle in which Mai displays amazing skill but is overpowered by how wicked Marik is. He turns the duel into a Shadow Game: when a monster is destroyed its owner will lose pieces of their memory. She starts losing memory of her friends. Marik loses memories of their underlings but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care. Mai is tortured by this experience. Yugi tries to help her using his Millennium Puzzle and interfering with the Shadow Game, angering Marik and encouraging her to win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She turns things around with great skill. At one point she even steals his God Card and summons it but is unable to control it due to not knowing the special chant. He takes controls of it and unlocks its sealed form. She is then chained by some monsters and cannot move. Jonouchi climbs to the stage to free her, and although she does not remember him, he is able to make her remember him by telling her the truth about his own vision after being struck by Ra. The god attacks them, but Yugi jumps and takes the blast. He gets knocked out but he just saved their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai thus loses the duel and Marik sends her to hell with the power of his Millennium Rod. Her mind becomes trapped in a giant hourglass where she will slowly forget all her friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group is standing in Mai&amp;rsquo;s room and she is unconscious. There is nothing they can do as she has lost a Shadow Game. Shizuka stays with her and the rest go to see the final duel between Kaiba (number 1) and Ishizu (number 8). She arrives to the arena and reveals who she is, also stating that she is Marik&amp;rsquo;s sister. Kaiba then reveals to everyone that it was her who was originally behind this whole tournament, and that she gave him Obelisk. Ishizu mentions that she originally said that Kaiba will return that card to her, and this duel will be the moment he does that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu and Kaiba &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, and although he seems to have the initial advantage, she is unfazed and completely outplays him thanks to the power of her Millennium Tauk. When Ishizu has him cornered and nearly out decked, it seems that her vision will come true and that Kaiba will be defeated. Suddenly Kaiba receives a vision of his own from the Millennium Rod that Marik holds, much to his surprise too. Kaiba ends up making an inexplicable move and sacrifices his God to summon his Blue-Eyes. This is the first time that Kaiba sees Ishizu surprised by the duel, and he takes it as an indication that his move was correct. He attacks and wins, thwarting fate itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu, surprised and defeated, is also hopeful because just as he changed his own future, she now has the hope that the future in which she saw her brother suffering forever can also be changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s Duel with Ishizu, Mokuba leads him to where the script of Ra is being translated. Kaiba is startled to realize that he somehow understands the hieratic text and can read the words on his own. He falls to his knee, overwhelmed, wondering what is happening to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The announcer declare through the airship speakers that the final duels of the tournament will take place the following day in the third and final arena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elsewhere on the ship, Yugi and the others go to see Mai out of worry, where they are joined by Ishizu. Yugi questions her as to why Marik wants him dead and Ishizu agrees to tell them the whole story of her family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ishtars are the guardians of the Millennium Items and live underground in secret, away from everyone else. The secret of the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s memory is carried over from generation to generation, carved into the back of the succeeding male in ceremony (a fate which in this generation fell on Marik&amp;rsquo;s shoulders). One year after Marik&amp;rsquo;s ceremony, he planned with Ishizu and Rishid to sneak outside after their father went to bed. Ishizu reluctantly agreed after Rishid said he will help if anything went wrong, but she said that it will only be for an hour in the following morning. Marik was ecstatic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early the next morning, after having put a pillow in Marik&amp;rsquo;s bed to make it seem like he was still sleeping, Ishizu and Marik slip out into the rising sun with Rishid. Marik was overwhelmed and fascinated by the outside world, the people and everything they found. On a nearby television set (which he has never seen before) he saw a man on a motorcycle drive off. Ishizu quickly dragged Marik off and reminded him that it was time to get back to the family. Marik begged Ishizu to let him keep a picture of the motorcycle. Ishizu, realizing there&amp;rsquo;s nothing she can do to dissuade him, told him to never let their father find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They run into Shadi who was just standing in the middle of the street and who tells them the Pharaoh is about to revive and that a fate of bloodshed and tragedy awaits. He also said that the tragedy is the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s will. He then disappears, telling Marik to find the Pharaoh. After searching and failing to find Shadi again, Ishizu tells Marik to forget all he saw that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon their return, Marik points out a device that acts as an alarm to tell of someone leaving the tomb. In the darkness, they had previously missed it. Ishizu runs off in panic for Rishid. They find Rishid being whipped by their father. Mr. Ishtar tries to hit Marik, but his evil persona emerges and catches the whip as it nears him. Releasing the whip, Marik takes the Millennium Rod and binds his father and Ishizu to the walls with magic, the latter of whom falls unconscious. Marik proceeds to stab his father to death with the Millennium Rod&amp;rsquo;s hidden blade. He is about to do the same to Ishizu, but Rishid regains consciousness and the Evil Marik is suppressed by the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik is completely unaware of what he did. Upon seeing his father&amp;rsquo;s body, he begins to panic. Shadi then appears above the body and says that it was the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s revival that led to that fate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Other Yugi realizes that his own revival is what led to the torment Marik is going through. Jonouchi, however, refuses to forgive Marik for what he has done to Mai and the rest of them, no matter what his reasons are. Ishizu states that they are the only ones who can save Marik from the darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi asks her about the God Cards and he tells him what she knows, on how she met Pegasus and they had a small &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; using the power of their Millennium Items that ended in a draw, which gave Pegasus the confidence to give her the cards for safekeeping. As she tells them this, Anzu and Honda recall what they saw back in Duelist Kingdom, that vision of Pegasus in ancient egyptian robes &lt;strong&gt;dueling&lt;/strong&gt; some gravekeeper. They thought it was a dream, but they are now convinced it was real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point there is a call for lights out on the ship and everyone prepares to depart. Anzu and Shizuka will stay in Mai&amp;rsquo;s room while Honda and Otogi will stay at Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi reminds Yugi of their promise to duel each other again. Shizuka jokes that Jonouchi should ask Ishizu to see if they will duel in the final, to which Ishizu states that, since her battle with Kaiba, she can no longer see the future. She then gives Yugi the Millennium Tauk, stating that Yugi still needs the other five Millennium Items and the three Egyptian God cards to awaken the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s memories. She also says that they originally belonged to Yugi and that now her job as a Tomb Keeper is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu chases after Ishizu, asking what will happen to the Other Yugi when the seven Millennium Items are returned to the tomb in Egypt. Ishizu simply replies that every soul has a place to return to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu is then taken control of and returns the Millennium Ring to Bakura, who wakes up instantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Yugi&amp;rsquo;s room, he and the Other Yugi talk of what will happen when all the items are returned, with Yugi saying that it&amp;rsquo;s his duty as his vessel to help him recover his memories (and shedding a tear when his back is turned).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Rishid&amp;rsquo;s room, Marik is about to kill him, but is distracted by Bakura revealing himself. Bakura states that the original Marik is with him. After a quick battle with their respective Millennium Items, they agree to play a Shadow Game for the items, with the only rule being that the loser will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the group is asleep after a really long day. Jonouchi is having a nightmare about losing Mai. Kaiba is still analyzing &amp;ldquo;Ra&amp;rdquo; and looking for ways to defeat him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the aerial arena, the evil Marik is about to duel against Bakura and the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik in a Shadow Game. Before the duel starts, Marik confronts his evil self and reveals that he has learned (through Anzu) about what really happened back then after Ishizu told the group. He now knows that it was him who actually killed his father. He reveals that he thought that the man that showed up that day (Shadi) was actually the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s soul and that he was the one who had killed his father. His whole anger towards the Pharaoh started there. He declares that both he and his evil self will pay for what they did to his father, and they will be destroyed together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his own thoughts, Bakura deduces that the turban-wearing man that Marik is talking about is Shadi, but also knows that five years ago he was already dead. So he&amp;rsquo;s been acting as a ghost ever since.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Yugi is dreaming and his Millennium Puzzle activate, allowing him to actually go to his other self Mind Room and talk to him there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this Shadow Game as their life point decrease, they will lose a portion of their body. It&amp;rsquo;s a back and forth &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. At one point Bakura forces the God Card to Marik&amp;rsquo;s hand and then takes it via Exchange, however Mairk uses other card effects to stop it from gaining attack on summon. With no use for it, Bakura tributes it. He believes to this to a safe move, because even if Marik were to revive &amp;ldquo;Ra&amp;rdquo;, it would have 0 ATK and DEF. However this backfires as &amp;ldquo;Ra&amp;rdquo; had an ability not even the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik Ishtar knew about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu wakes up, confused about being in Bakura&amp;rsquo;s room and not finding him there. She also was sure that she was in Mai&amp;rsquo;s room just moments ago so she is not sure how she got there. She goes to Yugi&amp;rsquo;s room and wakes him up. They go searching for Bakura. Eventually they take the elevator and find out about the duel that is taking place in the arena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to his greater connection with the Millennium Rod, the evil Marik knew about the Point-to-Point Transfer effect. He proceeds to revive &amp;ldquo;Ra&amp;rdquo; and use this effect to win the Duel, causing Bakura to be consumed by the shadows. As he disappears, Bakura vows to resurrect and kill Marik, identifying as the darkness itself. Marik then takes the Millennium Ring to himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The regular Marik takes control of Anzu and makes her leave the arena quickly. Ishizu wakes up from a nightmare in which she saw her brother engulfed in flames. Anzu (actually Marik) gets to her room and speaks with her, asking her to hide Rishid to protect him from his evil self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile the portion of Bakura sealed in the Millennium Puzzle wakes up and thinks about his next move. He will wait for now until the Millennium Items are gathered and, in the meantime, will search for the &amp;ldquo;Door of Truth&amp;rdquo; that lies somewhere within the Millennium Puzzle maze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evil Marik returns to Rishid&amp;rsquo;s room but he is not there. In the meantime Kaiba has analyzed everything he could about Ra and is worried about his powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following morning the airship arrives to Alcatraz, an island that belongs to Kaiba Corporation and was the headquarters of a previous military installments of the company before Seto took charge. Atop the wreckage stands the Duel Tower, the third and last battlefield for the Battle City finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik confronts Ishizu about the location of Rishid, and threatens her with his Millennium Rod after realizing she no longer has her Millennium Tauk to protect herself. But as they arrive to the island he says that sadly he does not have the time to brainwash her and extract the information about Rishid. As he leaves, Marik says that because Rishid was struck by the anger of Ra is probably that he won&amp;rsquo;t ever wake up again anyways. Laughing, he assures her that he will take his time killing Rishid after the duels are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi goes to see Mai but her condition hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed. The group reunites with Yugi who was still looking for Bakura but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find him. The group then leave the airship and goes towards the Duel Tower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need to decide the order for the semi-finals, and for that they will hold a four-way free-for-all &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. As each player&amp;rsquo;s Life Points decrease, their chair in the Duel Tower rises up. When a player&amp;rsquo;s LP reach 0 their chair will rise all the way to the top, to the setting for the Semi-Final round. The first two duelists to lose will face each other in the first Semi-Final. The two winners will face each other in the second Semi-Final. This allows each duelist to influence who he will face next by deciding to attack who at what time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the airship, Shizuka remembers how she met Mai and the words she gave her about her brother. Ishizu meanwhile ponders in the room where she hid Rishid, remembering how it all started and wishing for Rishid to wake up as things got terribly wrong when he lost conciousness. She also remembers how the day after Marik killed their father, he and Rishid left the place. That day she put on the Millennium Tauk for the very first time and saw the future, a very similar future to the one they were now experiencing. Some time after that, Marik stole the two egyptian gods but she confronted him when he tried to get Obelisk from a vault. He defeated her military guards using his Millennium Rod and she defeated his Ghouls using her Millennium Tauk, ending in a stalemate. He escaped with the help of Rishid. From that point onwards their destiny would lead to where they are now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back at the tower, Kaiba wants to duel Yugi so that, when he wins, he will have two Egyptian God Cards, as he knows he will need all the power he can get to stand up against The Winged Dragon of Ra. Yugi at first cannot decide who he wishes to face due to having reasons to fight everyone: Kaiba to settle their rivalry, Marik to defeat him and save his memories and Jonouchi, to keep his promise about dueling him in the finals, so he decides to wait and see what they will do. Jonouchi wants to duel Marik so he can win back Mai&amp;rsquo;s soul and claim revenge for her capture. Marik doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care who he faces or when, so he just plans to have fun wreaking as much havoc in this duel as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The duel is tense and rapidly changing, with strange alliances at every turn. In the end, Yugi and Kaiba rise as the winners and both Jonouchi and Marik will be the first two to duel in the first semifinal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first semi-final &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between Jonouchi and Marik is about to begin on the top of the Duel Tower. Honda calls Shizuka and tells her, but she says that she&amp;rsquo;ll stay with Mai and believe in her brother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the match begins, Marik initiates a Shadow Game with upped stakes. Dark energy strings connect the duelists to each monster they summon. As a monster is destroyed or weakened, a corresponding amount of &amp;ldquo;damage&amp;rdquo; is dealt to the monster&amp;rsquo;s owner. Anzu tells the Other Yugi about something that Jonouchi told her, that he wants to rescue Mai himself with his own strength and he is willing to end up in the same condition as her if that brings her back: he will do whatever it takes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the duel progresses Marik is surprised by how strong Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s willpower is to sustain the damage of the Shadow Game. Jonouchi plays amazingly and surprises everyone present. The duel end up in a really back and forth fight that forces Marik&amp;rsquo;s hand to even unleash the final secret ability of Ra: God Phoenix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, Shizuka feels that she needs to go there, and after Ishizu offers herself to look after Mai, Shizuka reaches the top of the tower just in time for the final part of the duel. Even facing the strongest Egyptian God in a Shadow Game, Jonouchi manages to somehow withstand the god&amp;rsquo;s attack and stay on his feet, barely conscious. Marik is terrified at this, realizing that he will lose if Jonouchi manages to summon a monster. With the last of his power Jonouchi draws and tries to summon his monster to make the final attack and win, but when he summons it the last bit of strength abandons him. The exhaustion and pain takes its toll and he plummets to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba rush to the platform and checks on him, only to realize that he is not breathing. Due to him not being able to continue, Marik wins by default. The group rush to him, trying to resucitate him. Marik is terrified of what just almost happened, but after a few moments he smiles and starts laughing. The medical team arrive and take Jonouchi to the ship. Despite losing a Shadow Game, Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s mind is battling the shadows and resisting being banished to hell like Mai. He nonetheless remains unconscious and is taken away for medical attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After examination, Jonouchi is in critical condition and they all feel desperate. Yugi walks out the room and punches the wall in anger and frustration. Suddenly, the Millennium Tauk on his pocket shines and he sees a vision of the future, a vision of him and Jonouchi dueling in Battle City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is then summoned to the second semi-final, so he goes to see Jonouchi once again and tells him that Jonouchi must keep fighting as a duelist so that they can duel again. Anzu runs after Yugi and tries to stop him, stating this tournament has been too dangerous and he should not duel. The Other Yugi (convinced that he must duel so the vision comes true) reminds her of the egyptian slab in the museum they saw together, and says that even though his life should have been gone a long time ago he is there now, alive, looking to find what has been lost. He tells her that he is convinced Jonouchi will be back, that as long as people have a reason to search for answers they will have a reason to live, a place to return. He will fight as a True Duelist to make his promise to Jonouchi a reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second semi-final &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between Yugi and Kaiba begins. They duel in a field of an ancient Roman coliseum. They summon their powerful Egyptian Gods and clash with each other in an insane duel of skill and mindgames. At one point, an attack from Osiris that misses hits the skyline causing lightning bolts to shoot down from the sky. This reactivates the power levels of Seto&amp;rsquo;s blimp, allowing Mokuba to call a helicopter for Jonouchi and activating the broadcast of the Duel on Battle City&amp;rsquo;s giant screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Jonouchi is having visions of the past, of how he fought his very first tournament: the District Duel Tournament before Duelist Kingdom. But the visions are a bit different, he hears some voices, and he has his current deck. Somehow, in his mind, Jonouchi is fighting to come back to life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the Sky Duel Coliseum, the fated duel and the clash of the gods ends up in a gigantic explosion when the two gods defeat eachother at the same time. A bright light emerges, destroying the giant tv screens of the city and blinding everyone on the island. Marik&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Rod starts to glow in response, just like Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle. The light transports the souls of Yugi and Kaiba back to ancient Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a destroyed ancient egypt, a giant pyramid can be seen upside-down in the sky. Everything is in ruins. Statues of Osiris and Obelisk can be seen in the distance. Then the scenery changes and they get transported inside the royal palace where they witness a duel between what seems to be their own previous lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priest that looks like Seto claims that &amp;ldquo;the High Priest of Darkness has conquered Heaven and Earth with his evil power, and that even his Millennium Items were worthless against the power of darkness&amp;rdquo;. The Pharaoh asks why has he submitted to them. The priest replies that he and his faithful servant shall forever be his enemy. They wield the Puzzle and the Rod against each other. The priest claims that he will defeat him with his own hands and summons his powerful servant: the White Dragon. The Pharaoh summons his powerful servant: the Black Magician. They shout &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Diaha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; as their powers clash in a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Kaiba are transported back to the present as the light fades and the Rod and Puzzle stop shining. They are still in disbelief of what they just saw. Marik is confused as to why his Rod activated itself and what they saw after that. The Other Yugi is sure that the vision was a part of his past, even if Kaiba refuses to believe it. They continue their duel using his other monsters and are back again at full intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the end, Yugi feels the presence of Jonouchi and turns around Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s attack by summoning Red-Eyes. At this moment, Jonouchi wakes up, to everyone&amp;rsquo;s relief. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand why Mai is still in that state because he is sure that he defeated Marik, but then Shizuka explains what actually happened to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi apologizes to Mai and tries to go see Yugi&amp;rsquo;s duel despite the doctor objections, specially now that the helicopter with medical help has arrived. He insists on going, even after Anzu tries to convince him, and tells her about the promise he made to Yugi, which makes her remember Yugi&amp;rsquo;s final words before his duel. She then agrees and they all run to see the match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top of the tower, the duel continues and reaches its climax. Kaiba puts up a fantastic final attack but Yugi then comes up with an even better final strategy and ends the duel in fantastic fashion, finally defeating Kaiba and declaring that the anger and hatred that Kaiba feels would never lead him to true victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a really intense couple of duels, the finalist of the Battle City tournament are decided: Yugi vs Marik. The final duel will begin shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba, in desbelief after losing at his own tournament and refusing to accept the words that Yugi give him about his friends giving him enough strength to win, tosses Obelisk to Yugi and walks away in a huff. But then, Jonouchi stands in his way and challenges him to a duel for the third place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s ideology that a True Duelist doesn&amp;rsquo;t need the power of a friend, clashes with Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s words. He accepts the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; and they both go to ground level to fight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu gets mind-controlled again and leaves as the duel starts. She encounters Ishizu and reveals that the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik has been hiding inside her mind since the previous night. They talk about the Ishtar family and everything that happened so far. In the end, the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik says that he will take care of his evil personality and asks Ishizu to take care of Rishid, as Anzu starts running towards the Duel Tower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik is standing on top of the Duel Tower, still thinking about the vision that the Millennium Rod and Puzzle gave to Yugi and Kaiba. He is pissed that the Rod is not replicating the vision for him, even though he is the owner of the Item, and tosses it to the ground. The Millennium Rod ends up at the feet of Anzu, who has just arrived and picks it up. Marik tries to grab the Rod but Anzu uses its powers to push him aside and reveal that it is indeed the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik taking control of her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The duel continues and Kaiba has the advantage but Jonouchi puts up a good fight. At this point the Millennium Puzzle react to what is happening with Marik, and Yugi sees a glimpse of Anzu&amp;rsquo;s face. Worried about her he runs towards the Duel Tower too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On top of the Duel Tower, Anzu has Marik&amp;rsquo;s cornered and is threatening him with her Millennium Rod, pushing him to the very edge of the platform. The evil Marik manages to distract his other self by talking about Rishid and takes the opportunity to grab Anzu&amp;rsquo;s arm and pull her, taking the Rod from her and turning the tables on the situation. Now Anzu is the one pushed to the edge, but she makes an acrobatic move and frees herself from it, dodging Marik&amp;rsquo;s attack. She later receives a full force energy blast of the Millennium Rod, pushing her to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as Marik is about to kill her, Ishizu shows up. The power of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Marik has weakened by now and Anzu pass out. The evil Marik now attempts to kill Ishizu but Yugi shows up, stopping him with the power of his Millennium Puzzle. They are about to clash with magic, but Marik leaves the place instead, saying they will solve everything in the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu is still passed out from Marik&amp;rsquo;s mind control. Ishizu tells Yugi that her brother is growing weak and he will continue growing weak until he is no more. She tells him that he can destroy the evil within Marik&amp;rsquo;s dark side by defeating him in his next Duel but if Yugi loses it would be the end of everything. She begs him to save her brother. The Other Yugi feels responsible because the Tomb Keepers had been guarding the Items and protecting his own memories for so long, so he promises that he will defeat his dark half and save him from the dark curse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just then Anzu finally regains consciousness and awakes, Yugi immediately notice and rushes over to her. She had no idea why she was up at the tower, with the last thing she remembers was watching Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Duel with Kaiba. Yugi wonders why would Marik go after Anzu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back at the third-place duel, in the end, the experienced duelist proves to be too strong and even if Jonouchi makes some impressive moves, Kaiba ends up winning. Yugi, Anzu and Ishizu arrive but the duel has already ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba, having nothing that matters to him anymore decides to leave the island and detonate it, though Ishizu catches up to him and tries to convince him to watch the final Duel as well as help Yugi beat Marik. She then talks about the stone tablet and how it has written in it a prayer for the dead in Hieratic writing known as the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;pert kertu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, a message that the Priest inscribed to &amp;ldquo;his true friend&amp;rdquo;, the late Pharaoh: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The corpse sinks to the floor. The vessel becomes sand, becomes dust. Even the brightest gold, even the sharpest sword is wrapped in the sheath of time. Woe to the Pharaoh, for his body lacks even his name. Time is a battlefield of souls. I cry the song of battle, the song of a friend. To the place far away where souls meet&amp;hellip; guide me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba asks what does she means with it and she says that just as the Priest and the Pharaoh in the tablet were rivals they were also friends. And this is the time for him to help Yugi aswell. Kaiba refuses to do anything as the only point of his tournament was so that could be the #1 Duelist again, but because of his loss against Yugi, that&amp;rsquo;s no longer possible, so his only option now is to destroy the island.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba remembers what Yugi and Jonouchi said about his brother in their Duels against him, that hater and anger wont lead him to the right path, and that he should have fun in the duels. Mokuba states to Seto that destroying the island won&amp;rsquo;t do any good for anyone, including themselves. Due to this and remembering on how his brother was in the past compared to now, Mokuba reveals that he really wants to see his brother as he used to be, smiling and enjoying games from the bottom of his heart. Instead of causing more damage, Kaiba should try and help Yugi beat Marik since Kaiba did figure out a way to beat &amp;ldquo;Ra&amp;rdquo; and was planning on using it against Marik before he lost. Kaiba is left conflicted, but he ultimately decides to do so. As the final Duel begins, Kaiba gives Yugi the card he planned to use to defeat Yami Marik.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; begins. Its a Shadow Game played between the Other Yugi and the evil Marik: as each player&amp;rsquo;s Life Points decrease, their respective hosts (Yugi Muto and Marik Ishtar) will have more and more of their body wiped out. When a player loses, both spirit and host will be sent to hell. However, Marik would not be sent to hell along with his &amp;ldquo;host&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; spirit if he loses, since he is an alter ego that Marik created himself, whereas the Other Yugi is a completely different spirit living dependably inside Yugi&amp;rsquo;s body with Yugi&amp;rsquo;s own spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The duels begins strong, and they quickly manage to summon the Gods to face each other. During the duel Marik also reveals that it was him who defeated Bakura, and shows the Millennium Ring as proof. At one point, Yugi places his trust in destiny and, with his eyes closed, draws and sets a card without even looking at it. They are all surprised at this, and Kaiba looks around and sees Ishizu staring at him, which makes him realize that somehow the card just played was probably the one he gave Yugi. And it was. Using that card Yugi manages to protect himself from Marik&amp;rsquo;s insane one-turn-kill attack and keep fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spirit of the normal Marik shows up in the airship near Rishid&amp;rsquo;s bed to say goodbye and apologize as he feels that he is going to disappear soon. Back in the duel, Dark Marik&amp;rsquo;s strategy continues to evolve and he manages to gain the upper hand once again with his powerful God Slime. Then, normal Marik takes control of Anzu in front of everyone and speaks with Yugi, saying that there is no need to hold back and that he is prepared to die, explaining to the rest what is actually happening in the shadow game (they cannot see the other selfs of the duelist actually in combat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik pushes the Pharaoh to its limits, but he finds a way to turn the tables and properly defeat Ra against all odds. In addition to this, Rishid managed to wake up and slowly made his way to the battlegound, and by doing this, he helps Marik takes control of his own body once again, which changes Marik and the evil Marik&amp;rsquo;s position in the shadow game. The normal Marik now stands as Yugi&amp;rsquo;s opponent, and in his final move he surrenders by placing his hand on his deck, erasing his dark self forever and giving Yugi the victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the aftermath of the duel, Yugi becomes the champion of the tournament and is once again crowned Duel King. He also gets the last Egyptian God card as per the ante rule. On the other hand, Marik is freed from his evil self and reunites with his sister and with Rishid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marik then gives the Pharaoh his Millennium Rod and Ring, and also the Millennium Eye that apparently Bakura had in his possession too. Then Marik shows him the carvings on his back as his final duty of a Tomb Keeper. Ishizu proceeds to read some of them out loud: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the future, one will come who will wield the power of the three gods depicted on the stone slab. This will be proof that the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s soul has been reincarnated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Yugi finds out he can read the symbols himself, and as he does he sees a brief vision of the stone slab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba announces that he will destroy Alcatraz in exactly one hour, and they all rush to the airship before the island explodes. Jonouchi goes to see Mai and is devastated that she is still in bed. But she was messing with him and she and Shizuka laugh about it. They later find Bakura in the kitchen, eating a bunch of food, without a worry in the world. The ship is about to depart but they cant find Seto or Mokuba anywhere. Just as they are leaving and the detonation starts, they hear Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s laugh and see that he and Mokuba emerge from the devastation in a Blue-Eyes-shaped jet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba and Kaiba depart, saying they are going to America to develop their new Kaiba Land over there and all over the world. Yugi realizes that Kaiba has started a journey towards his new dream and smiles about it, hoping that he would leave that hatred behind with the destroyed island. The group then starts their journey back to Domino City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in Domino City, Ishizu and Marik thank Yugi for helping defeat the evil persona. They will rebuild their family in a new direction, now that their generational duty has been fulfiled. Marik says that on the day Yugi visits Egypt he wishes to be his guide. Ishizu says that she will start the preparations for his arrival to the place they would need to go in Egypt, but that he first must find the rest of the Millennium Items. Yugi would need to somehow contact Shadi for the Key and the Scales (something easier said than done). The Ishtars then leave with Rishid to go back home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otogi says that he will also leave to America to continue working closely with Industrial Illusions (specially after hearing what Kaiba said about Kaiba Land), and departs from them but not before sneakingly giving Shizuka his phone number. Honda yells at him for this but later says to take care. As they talk about their future, Honda grabs Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s hand and also gives her his phone number, so Jonouchi yells at him and they all laugh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai then announce that she is leaving as well. After Mai and Shizuka exchange words of thanks between them, she tells Yugi she won&amp;rsquo;t lose to him again before departing. As she turns around and leaves in a hurry, Jonouchi catches her as she&amp;rsquo;s getting on the car. She says that their friendship was a little too bright for her, but they depart on good terms and smiling. As she leaves and is out of their sight, her face turns somber as she thinks about everything that happened to her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The city is fascinated by what just happened and the news of the tournament extend like wildfire. The internet is also being flooded with images and videos of it and its protagonists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following morning, at sunrise, Yugi has finished a new deck and grabs the Red-Eyes Black Dragon card. He arrives to the designated area and encounters Jonouchi waiting for him. It&amp;rsquo;s time for the final &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, the promise of their Battle City clash as the sun rises behind Jonouchi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;As normal life returns, the Domino Museum becomes a point of interest for Yugi&amp;rsquo;s other self, who starts uncovering secrets of his past while several chained events happen in that place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My main goal in this arc was to tie multiple short storylines into the city&amp;rsquo;s museum and the egyptian backstory of &amp;ldquo;the other yugi&amp;rdquo;. Having the egyptian exhibition play a larger role here allows me to flesh out more characters like Ishizu and Shadi. A major goal of this arc aswell was to move the virtual arc here, to have it happen before Battle City which will in turn make Battle City flow better without that interruption before the finals. Overall, this whole Museum arc was also a good chance to focus on the side characters for a bit and plant some seeds for upcoming future plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Pegasus Castle, Yugi and his friends are reunited with Bakura and Mokuba. Mr. Crocketts apologizes for Pegasus being absent, and gives Yugi a card called &amp;ldquo;The Ties of Friendship&amp;rdquo; as proof of his championship title, along with the check for the prize, which Yugi gives to Jonouchi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside the castle the gang meet up with Kaiba, who is grateful to see his little brother Mokuba, but warns Yugi they will duel sooner or later. He then leaves toward his helicopter and the guys follow him asking if he can give them a ride to the city, something Mokuba happily agrees. Mai also joins them on the helicopter since she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have another way out of the island.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While flying home, they talk and start to rememorate duels from the tournament and how they got to the island. Jonouchi asks Mai about her first opponents and she briefly mentions the ones she defeated to get 8 stars as boring and uninteresting, with the exception of Jonouchi himself. That said, after her loss to Panik she felt in debt to Yugi so she started really early the following morning, searching duelists all over the island. There were few duelists left, and she assumed a bunch of them had been defeated by the Player Killers that night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a duel arena she found Kajiki and Ryuzaki &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-41---ryuzaki-vs-kajiki&#34; &gt;dueling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and decided to watch first and then duel the winner, since they were betting six star chips in total, 3 on each side (Ryuzaki had 3 chips after losing to Jonouchi). Yugi recalls that after he defeated Kajiki that first day Kajiki still had 1 star chip, so he definetely got one or two more wins after that to reach 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the end of that duel, Mai saw three duelists on the beach below them finding some star chips on the sand and screaming in joy about it. Jonouchi and Yugi interrupt her with surprise, saying that those were definetely the star chips Mokuba stole and were thrown into the sea. Kaiba, who was just passively hearing from the front seat, asks Mokuba about that. He admits with regret of stealing the chips from that poor kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi ask Mai to describe those three duelist and when she does, they clearly associate them to the ones they met on the Graveyard Field. Mai saw how those three kept a Star Chip each (that&amp;rsquo;s all they found apparently) and went into a cave near the beach. She followed their tracks, dismissing the Ryuzaki and Kajiki duel for the moment, and once she reached the cave she challenged them. Satake and Takaido ignored her and kept going through the caves, stating that they knew of a shortcut to the castle and that they had business with someone (Anzu assumes they meant Keith for sure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotsuzuka guided her to the Graveyard field, and once in there he revealed that he hid another star chip from the others. Mai &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-41---kotsuzuka-vs-mai&#34; &gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; him by betting all her 8 star chips for his 2, and defeated him. She then went ahead on the caves searching for the other two duelists and got lost. Halfway through her path she met Kajiki who was searching for her after defeating Ryuzaki. She agreed to duel him but only after they find the other two that fled, since she was thinking that defeating Kajiki and those two will net her with exactly 18 star chips to repay Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They walked through the caves, with Kajiki talking about his father and his duel with Ryuzaki that was a revenge for the japanese tournament, and a bunch of other things that Mai didn’t really cared about. They finally got to the Labyrinth entrance, which they went through just in time to see the Meikyu brothers finishing Takaido and Satake in a duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai teamed up with Kajiki to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-41---brother-mei--brother-kyu-vs-mai--kajiki&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Mei and Kyu. The two brothers however refused to bet Star Chips. They said that to leave the cave they would need to beat them, but that the time limit for the classification round was near and that the Player Killers were tasked by Pegasus to stall for time since there were less star chips available for duelists at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai and Kajiki won that hard fought duel, but didn’t get extra star chips for it. They got out of the Labyrinth but the time was running out and there weren’t any more duelist around so the two of them decided to bet all their star chips together and see which would make it to the castle. Mai won the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-41---kajiki-vs-mai&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and gathered 16 star chips in total. She would then go on to meet the guys and the rest is known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the others then talk about the finals. Bakura is shown quietly looking through the window. They all get to Domino Port in the middle of the night and part ways for now, with Kaiba declaring once again to Yugi that he will duel him at some point pretty soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the following morning, inside Kaiba Corporation headquarters, the Kaiba brothers confront The Big Five for making an alliance with Pegasus and trying to take over their company. However, they manipulate Kaiba into trying his new virtual game, Duel Monsters Quest. All seven go into the virtual world using some special virtual pod machines, but in reality this is their plan B after Pegasus&amp;rsquo; defeat. In secret the Big Five planned to defeat Kaiba in the virtual world using cheats, and have arranged the machine to have the loser of the duel actually lose their mind in the virtual world. By doing that, they would be able to take the company keys that the brothers hold and become the majority shareholder themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virtual world looks real and is brilliantly made. Suddenly, the Big Five change the environment and challenge Kaiba and Mokuba to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-42---the-big-five-vs-kaiba--mokuba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. They will be using the Boss Rules for team duels, which means that they would collectively share a board and have their turn iterate with the Kaiba brothers. Even after they stacked their deck to have the perfect initial hand and summoned &amp;ldquo;Five God Dragon&amp;rdquo;, a legendary Fusion monster, Kaiba takes the initiative and with the crucial help of his brother manages to overcome them and win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brothers leave the virtual world. Kaiba, unaware of what just happened to the minds of the Big Five and just seeing all of them unresponsive in their virtual simulator pods, orders his men to remove them from his presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day after returning to the city, Yugi goes to the hospital to see his grandfather and hugs him as he is conscious now, his mother is there aswell. Sugoroku is excited about the Egyptian Exhibition that is said to be coming soon to the city (he watched the news about that on the hospital TV early that day) and wants to get in contact with a friend of his, professor Yoshimori.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku is released from the hospital. Yugi and his friends take him home, where they find an American girl waiting for them. She introduces herself as Rebecca, a twelve-year-old prodigy Duelist who is accusing Sugoroku of stealing her &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo;. She demands it back, but the gang and Sugoroku have a problem with this as Seto ripped it up in the first episode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebecca challenges Sugoroku to a Duel for it, but since he just got out of the hospital, Yugi (and not his other-self) takes his place. They &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-43---rebecca-vs-yugi-arthur-vs-sugoroku&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the new arena in Kaiba Land. During the Duel, Sugoroku notices Rebecca&amp;rsquo;s Deck and strategy are very similar to an old friend of his named Arthur Hopkins. Rebecca reveals herself to be Arthur&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter, and continues to accuse him of theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku tells the story of how he met Arthur. It was at an archaeological dig in Egypt years ago. Arthur was reading some Egyptian hieroglyphs and noticed they resemble Duel Monsters, making him believe that ancient Egyptians used these monsters in battle for power and control. Unfortunately, no one believed him, but he never gave up on his research. One day, Sugoroku and Arthur were in a tomb when the roof caved in, trapping the two men. There was only enough water for one person, so they decide to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-43---rebecca-vs-yugi-arthur-vs-sugoroku&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for it. In the end, Sugoroku decided to surrender, even though he could have won, because he knew Arthur would need the water more than him. He notices the Duel between Rebecca and Yugi is going in the exact same way as the Duel he had back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, Yugi does surrender. Rebecca demands her &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; card back. Sugoroku reluctantly shows the card to Rebecca, which has been taped together. Rebecca rages out of control upon seeing this as she thinks Sugoroku tore it up. Sugoroku tries to tell Rebecca he would never do such a thing, but Rebecca again won&amp;rsquo;t listen to him. At this point, Arthur arrives and tells Rebecca to behave herself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthur shows Rebecca the top card of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Deck, which was &amp;ldquo;Soul Release&amp;rdquo;, and that it would have allowed Yugi to win the duel. Rebecca is shocked upon finding out about this, but she asks why did Yugi forfeit when he had the chance to win. Arthur explains that Yugi deliberately forfeited to teach Rebecca about the Heart of the Cards and that there is more to life than winning. Rebecca apologizes and to prove their friendship, Yugi gives her the &amp;ldquo;The Ties of Friendship&amp;rdquo; card. Sugoroku talks a bit with his friend, asking him why is he there and Arthur explains that he’s in the city to see the egyptian exhibition on the museum that’s coming up in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthur mention that he got the Blue-Eyes card originally from Pegasus, after he consulted with him in regards to Duel Monsters and egyptology design. He also forgives Sugoroku for what happened with the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back in school we can see Anzu and Honda having a practice &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-44---honda-vs-anzu&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that Anzu wins. Honda is getting practice but he is still a total newcomer. Meanwhile Jonouchi is a bit jealous that a new student called Ryuji Otogi is attracting all the girls with dice tricks. Otogi gets Jonouchi involved with one of the tricks, and by playing off of Jonouchi’s gullibility, the trick works. Jonouchi gets angry and he challenges him to a duel. Otogi agrees but only if they duel by drafting new booster packs. They also make a bet, the loser will be the winner’s pet for a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They go to Otogi’s game shop that has a Duel Arena. While getting there a small flashback is shown of Otogi discussing getting revenge against Yugi with an employee of his. He claims that Yugi only defeated Pegasus in Duelist Kingdom by cheating, and plans to expose him to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game shop is full of people. Otogi says that he will broadcast the duel on the screens and they draft the cards. Jonouchi is confident with what he got. Then the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-44---otogi-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; begins, and after some back and forth Jonouchi makes some big misplays by not knowing or reading properly his cards and Otogi ends up taking the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having won the bet, Otogi orders Jonouchi to put on a dog suit that he got him. Seeing his friend humiliated by Otogi, Yugi gets angry and challenges him to a duel. If he wins, Jonouchi will be released from the deal. Otogi agrees, but says that if he wins, Yugi will swear on his grandfather’s life that he will never play Duel Monsters again and give up his title of “King of Games”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Yugi has to learn on the go and struggles at first, but eventually is able to pull up a good combo and wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the duel Otogi tells him about how he is the actual inventor of the Dungeon Dice Field along with some other cards, that he started to collaborate with Industrial Illusions as a card designer and that he wanted to push his project forward. He had a contract with them and even met Pegasus himself, but after the Duelist Kingdom tournament was over Pegasus has dropped off the face of the earth. Therefore he had some grudge against Yugi, blaming him for what happened to Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duel, Otogi apologizes for how he treated them and they all end up in good terms. Moments later, his laptop signals a message. He opens the email, and with a thrill, he sees that Industrial Illusions has sent a production contract after all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: Instead of a Dungeon Dice Monster duel they will play a normal duel but with DDM terrain and rules, as a way to mix both ideas. The focus of this project is on Kingdom Duels so its best if we keep everything related to the rules we are creating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Egyptian Exhibition is about to begin in a few days and the Domino Museum staff is hard at work preparing for it. At school, Jonouchi is having a practice &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-46---honda-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with Honda when Yugi tells them about the exhibition and that his grandpa can let them in on the premiere day thanks to him knowing a university professor who works there. They all decide to go (although Jonouchi is scared of mummies), but when he checks the date he says that he might not be able to go with them after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi tells them that he has received the prize money from Industrial Illusions and started the process of scheduling her sisters operation. Shizuka herself is coming to visit him on that very same day when the museum exhibition begins, so he don&amp;rsquo;t think he can go with them. Instead, they all agree to hang out with her instead, regardless of what Jonouchi wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later they meet Shizuka at Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s place, in the morning, and Honda falls for her at first sight. Otogi joins them too this time, after being invited by Yugi and Anzu. They all go to spend the day together, a happy slice of life day. Shizuka is a kind soul and she is proud of her brother, and grateful of him giving her the chance of being able to cure her eyes. She is secretly worried about the operation, and although she says nothing, Anzu picks up on this and comforts her for a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point in the afternoon Yugi tells them that he is leaving to go with his grandpa to the museum for the opening of the exhibition, but they all decide to join him anyway, including Shizuka and Otogi. They arrive and meet Sugoroku waiting for them alongside two other men. They are greeted by professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s friend) and Kanekura (the curator of the museum), who stares at Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle for a bit but says nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They spend the rest of the day there, roaming around the museum while Yoshimori gives them the tour, explaining different egyptian concepts like for example the Weighting of the Feather and the judgment: The crimes that people made would be measured with a scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few important egyptian pieces that will be arriving in a few days, but Yoshimori says that there is also a really interesting collaboration that they are having that week with Kaiba Corporation and their virtual reality pods, that can transport one to a virtual recreation of ancient egypt so they can actually walk and explore that place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interested in the experience, they all go into the pods and jump into the virtual world. They start wandering, surprised by how real everything feels, when suddenly something strange happens and the landscape changes as they fell in what seems like an endless digital pit of green numbers and grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside the pods, in the real world, Yoshimori is worried because the equipment seems to be malfunctioning. Sugoroku attempts to free Yugi but Yoshimori stops him, saying that freeing them now could cause damage in their brains. He wonders how could this be happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group (Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Anzu, Otogi and Shizuka) were exploring an egyptian temple in a virtual reality pod in the museum when they got trapped inside. Arriving to a weird digital-looking place, they are unsure of what is happening, when suddenly a young kid with teal hair shows up in multiple screens in front of them. He presents himself as Noah, and says that they were all invited there as a suggestion of his allies: the Big Five, who show up in multiple screens aswell. They explain who they are, and what happened to them after their duel with Kaiba and Mokuba, when they got trapped in the virtual space forever. They want revenge against Kaiba and are using the oportunity of the virtual reality pods deployed in the museum to trap Yugi, in order to lure Kaiba in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point Noah speaks directly to the camera, and we see that Kaiba and Mokuba have their own computer screens hacked by this kid. Noah directly confronts Kaiba, challenging to go there and save his so-called enemy as he knows he is in debt to Yugi for defeating Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah then says to the group that he is stealing something from Kaiba for them to use while they are in the virtual world: his new and renovated duel disk that would allow them to have a duel pretty much anywhere. These virtual duel disks would be just a projection, but would still work like the real ones that Kaiba has been developing in secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Big Five then propose a challenge to Yugi and the rest of the group: a Duel Monsters battle within the virtual world. If they win they can get out, but if any of the gang loses a duel to one of The Big Five, the winner will gain control of their body and escape to the real world while the loser&amp;rsquo;s mind will be trapped in the virtual world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have introduced a new set of rules where each duelist has a &amp;ldquo;Deck Master&amp;rdquo;, a special card that acts as a main monster for them. The Big Five make a simple demostration of the rules, explaining that if a Duelist&amp;rsquo;s Deck Master is destroyed then that would mean losing the duel in the spot. To put the odds in their favor, the Big Five declare that they will be dueling anyone currently present before them, not only the duelists, so this includes Honda, Anzu and Shizuka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba is pissed off and tries to hack his way into that server in order to cut off their plans, but Noah declares that it is futile and that the amount of redundancies are countless. He has been planning this for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group protests, specially Jonouchi in defense of his sister, but the Big Five just laugh and splits them all, sending each of them to a different location within the virtual world, as the transmission cuts off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba asks his brother what is he going to do. Kaiba orders Mokuba to stay there while he deals with it. Without wasting much time, he grabs something from a drawer, walks onto the virtual pods within Kaiba Corporation and go into the virtual world despite his brother&amp;rsquo;s protests. Mokuba, after seeing his brother jump in, decides to ignore his order and go in aswell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is dropped through virtual tunnels and ends up isolated in a different place of the virtual world: Yugi arrived to some sort of swamp, Kaiba ended up in a forest, Mokuba in a beach, Jonouchi in the outside of what seems to be a manor, Anzu in a canyon, Honda in a library, Otogi in a fancy hall, and Shizuka near a pond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah sends Oshita from the Big Five to challenge Yugi, but since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a body he takes the form of &amp;ldquo;Deepsea Warrior&amp;rdquo; which will serve as his Deck Master. Once there he challenges Yugi, who first needs to build his deck from a projection of virtual cards. Going through the cards, Yugi is about to choose Dark Magician as his Deck Master but Kuriboh emerges from the card on his own. He protests that he didn&amp;rsquo;t choose that card but Oshita declares that once chosen it cannot be changed, so Yugi decides to trust in Kuriboh who seems happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-48---oshita-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the swamp, quickly getting used to the duel disks, and even as Oshita boasts his knowledge of philosophy and warfare to deplete Yugi&amp;rsquo;s reserves, in the end Yugi with the help of Kuriboh manages to win. When he does, a door shows up floating in the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda finds Otogi as they actually were in the same building. They try to get out but the hallways seem to be endless. On a different area, Anzu is being chased by some monsters and falls unconscious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu wakes up in a cave, having been kidnapped by a group of Cyclops. She discovers they plan on cooking her, but she is rescued when a penguin drops a vine down a hole in the cave ceiling for her. After escaping, the Cyclops chase her over a wooden bridge, which collapses under their weight. The giants fall to their deaths while Anzu barely holds on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Honda and Otogi have managed to break free from that place by using axes and maces to destroy the hallway. They emerge outside where they find Shizuka running from a dangerous beast, and they manage to save her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba wanders in the beach and finds a working TV in the middle of the sand that is still on. It shows his brother walking through the forest. Suddenly a door shows up in front of Kaiba, who opens it and finds himself in a vivid picture of the orphanage that he and Mokuba used to live in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu stands up and finds the penguin that saved her, who leads her to a raft which takes her to a beach filled with more penguins. One of them in particular can speak, and reveals to be Otaki, another of the Big Five, in the form of &amp;ldquo;Nightmare Penguin&amp;rdquo;. He challenges her to a duel in the icy environment, and when she rans away she ends up trapped in a block of ice surrounded by water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu gets to build her deck and choose her deck master, and she picks Fire Sorcerer to be the one. As they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-49---otaki-vs-anzu&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in there, he seems to get the advantage and as he deals damage to her she starts to become encased in ice. Pulling her last strength, Anzu manages to turn around the duel in the end and win, marking a second victory over the Big Five members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah is shown watching in multiple screens where everyone is. He lures Kaiba into the orphanage and displays a projection of his life there, while Mokuba watches on that TV in the sands. They watch the day that Kaiba challenged Gozaburo to a chess match and won. Gozaburo had agreed to adopt the brother if he lost. The scene changes and this time it is showing their life with Gozaburo. Kaiba was forced to overwork in his studies. When his toys were taken away, Mokuba saved his Duel Monsters cards and tried to cheer him up by sneaking them to him along with a drawing of a &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; card. In the present day, Noah mocks the brothers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Yugi has found Anzu and they go through some door that appeared in the middle of the icy tundra. On a different area, Honda, Otogi and Shizuka walk through another of those doors and find themselves in a big hangar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi has wandered around the manor for a long time and is getting angry. He bumps into a door and finds himself in a courtroom, with the next member of the Big Five waiting for him. It is Ooka, taking the form of &amp;ldquo;Judge Man&amp;rdquo;. Jonouchi builds his deck and picks &amp;ldquo;Flame Swordsman&amp;rdquo; as his Deck master. They &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-50---ooka-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Jonouchi uses a lot of dice-related cards in order to try to push his advantage, but he keeps failing every coin toss. Yugi and Anzu manage to get there in the middle of the duel, and they cheer for their friend. Suddenly Noah actually appears and declare that the duel is invalid as Ooka has been cheating, he says that he will just eliminate Ooka but Jonouchi stops him and wins the duel despite the cheating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba (and Mokuba) are still seeing the scenes from the past. Seto wonders who this kid actually is, why is he so obssessed with him and surpassing him, and who may be behind all of this, as he doesn&amp;rsquo;t think that Noah is capable of pulling a plan like this on his own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honda and the other two find the next member of the Big Five waiting for them in the hangar they just appeared into. It is Ota in the form of his &amp;ldquo;Machine Sergeant&amp;rdquo; Deck Master. He plans to duel Shizuka, but Honda and Otogi (knowing her inexperience with dueling) negotiate with him and agree to a 3v1 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-51---shizuka--honda--otogi-vs-ota&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They build their decks and pick their respective Deck Masters (Raremetal Knight for Honda, Swift-Strike Black Ninja for Otogi and Goddess of the Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye for Shizuka). During the duel she makes a lot of mistakes that Ota takes advantage of, and while Honda and Otogi try to cover for her it ends up leading to a really difficult decision. Making the ultimate move, Honda sacrifices his Deck Master to save her, but that means that he has lost the duel. The duel then continues in a 2v1. Devastated by this, Shizuka ends up gathering enough courage to get an advantage and, together with Otogi, avenge Honda by defeating Ota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the duel was happening, Jonouchi, Yugi and Anzu had been walking through a cave looking for them. They finally manage to arrive and cheer Shizuka in her final turn. The duel ends with a bittersweet victory, because Honda has been defeated and thus has lost his body to the Big Five.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honda&amp;rsquo;s mind has somehow found a way to a robot monkey card, and he has taken that form. His friends are now going through what seems to be a city when they encounter Kaiba. Suddenly, Ota in Honda&amp;rsquo;s body shows up and attacks Seto with a steel bar, but he is stopped by monkey-Honda. He escapes in a motorcycle and Seto pursues him in another one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though monkey-Honda cannot speak, Shizuka picks him up and convince the others to take him with them as he helped Kaiba. They try to follow Kaiba and find a pickup truck. At some point monkey-Honda flips a switch on his head that allows him to speak normally, but Jonouchi and Otogi dont trust him yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba is stopped by Daimon on the road, crashing his motorbike, and the two of them begin a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-52---daimon-vs-kaiba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Like his associates, Daimon is in the form of his Deck Master, but he has disguised it with clothes, a hat, and sunglasses. Kaiba does not attempt to learn his identity, and only when Leichter uses his ability to destroy Trap Cards, it is revealed to be &amp;ldquo;Jinzo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Mokuba finds himself in an unfamiliar room. The TV in the sand disappeared and everything was replaced with what he sees now. Noah is in that room, they talk for a bit and they both watch Seto&amp;rsquo;s duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During their duel, Daimon reveal how Kaiba managed to end up being who he is, and some of the things he did to become the chairman of Kaiba Corporation. Kaiba declares that he is going to purge the Big Five once and for all, and with a display of pure strength he pulls off the win.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After Kaiba defeats Daimon, he runs off in search of Mokuba now that he knows he is there. Yugi and Anzu run after him while the rest of the gang are stuck behind with the pickup truck. Following the cries of a baby, they find themselves inside a manor a framed portait of Noah posing with Gozaburo. Another door takes them to a projection revealing that Noah is Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s son, and he originally planned to adopt Seto in order to motivate Noah in his studies. Yugi gives Kaiba the portrait of Noah and Gozaburo, who disregards the entire story as false because the photo was dated six years previously, but Noah has not aged since then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Noah&amp;rsquo;s place, Mokuba tries to reason with him, believing that he is the son of Gozaburo and therefore like a brother to him. Noah is not interested in him that much, but Mokuba challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-53---noah-vs-mokuba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in order to make his feelings reach him. He is no match for Noah and is defeated, but Noah ends the duel with a pensive look on his face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Oshita, Otaki, Ooka and Daimon chase the rest of the gang in an attempt to forcefully steal their bodies. Joey summons five monsters to stall them and they attempt to escape in the truck. After a harrowing chase, Noah rescues the gang from The Big Five since stealing their bodies by force is against his rules. Kaiba keeps going in search of Mokuba and Yugi and Anzu are reunited with the others shortly afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Noah speaks with The Big Five. Ota is ready to leave the Virtual World in Honda&amp;rsquo;s body, but the rest are in danger of dismissal for their failures. They beg Noah for one more chance. Noah gives them their opportunity, and as their final chance for escape, the Big Five challenge Yugi and his friends, each one of them taking turns speaking through Honda&amp;rsquo;s body and bringing their Deck Masters in rotation. If Yugi and his friends win, they will give Honda&amp;rsquo;s body back. If the Big Five win they will keep all their bodies. They plan to take advantage of the inexperience of the others to be a burden to Yugi&amp;rsquo;s duelist capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-54---honda-vs-jonouchi--anzu--yugi--shizuka--otogi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; begins and is going back and forth, but in the end a great combination of the gang manages to break the enemy and take the win, or so it seems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Kaiba has reached Noah and demands for him to return Mokuba, who is nowhere to be seen. He then finds out about Noah&amp;rsquo;s funeral.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After they lose, the Big Five cheat to stay alive and make an impossible field against yugi in a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-55---the-big-five-vs-yugi--kaiba&#34; &gt;new duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, declaring that with him gone the rest would stand no chance later. Noah has detected this and teleports himself and Kaiba to the duel to stop them, but Kaiba is pissed off and stops him in his tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He joins the duel in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s team, suffering a intrusion penalty. Together, they face Five God Dragon and this time they destroy it for good by bringing Dragon Master Knight, a legendary combination of their strongest monsters. Noah permanently deletes the Big Five for cheaters after this, and Honda is left devastated thinking that he will never get his body back.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah teleports Kaiba and the rest to a volcanic area and the two of them start their most anticipated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-56---noah-vs-kaiba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. At one point, Noah shows a sphere in the sky to Kaiba, revealing that it contains a digitized version of his brain and has kept him alive in virtual reality after he died in a car accident six years previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah reveals that when his mind was digitized, he was able to rapidly gain knowledge from Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s computer database until he was more intelligent than any human. A flashback reveals that when Noah first existed in virtual reality, he was often visited by his father, who gave him a town to live in and people to interact with. Noah soon grew frustrated with the limitations of the world so he began to reprogram it. He told Gozaburo his idea of improving the virtual world by connecting it to networks around the real world. When he asked Gozaburo if he was capable of taking over Kaiba Corporation, Gozaburo refused to discuss it. Without Noah&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, he started to focus more on the newly adopted Seto and Mokuba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a hard fought duel, Kaiba manages to find an opening and defeats Noah.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah realizes that he&amp;rsquo;d lost because Seto has the courage to never give up, even when the situation seemed hopeless. Left alone in the Virtual World for six years after his accident, Noah felt that his father, Gozaburo, forgot him upon Seto&amp;rsquo;s arrival into the Kaiba family. Because of this, he blames his stepbrother for robbing him of his birthright of ownership of the family company, and he intended to take revenge by escaping to the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moments later, Gozaburo Kaiba reveals his own virtual self to Noah and the gang and explains the story behind Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s adoption: initially, Kaiba was to become a replacement body for Noah&amp;rsquo;s digitized mind, but Gozaburo later determined that Seto&amp;rsquo;s mind was perfectly good and realized that even though Noah would have a body, his son would never truly grow up and would always remain a spoiled brat in spirit. Gozaburo turned his attention toward training Kaiba into becoming the businessman who would someday inherit Kaiba Corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s takeover of the company ruined Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s plans. Humiliated, he uploaded his own mind into Noah&amp;rsquo;s virtual world and was never seen in the real world again. As the mastermind behind the events drawing Kaiba and the gang to the virutal world, Gozaburo unveils his new plan: to trap everyone&amp;rsquo;s minds in the real world into Virtual Reality using the global networking idea that Noah had conceived six years previously. In being uploaded to the virtual world, the population of Earth would essentially become immortal, and Gozaburo would be the powerful ruler of the new world. Noah realizes for the first time that, although Gozaburo promised to help him claim his birthright when he uploaded his own mind to the virtual world, he was actually just using Noah and The Big Five all along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah leads everyone to a door which he claims is the exit. Instead of entering the real world, they each become trapped in their memories until they realize they&amp;rsquo;ve been tricked and return to a virtual Domino City. Noah teleports away and takes Mokuba to the virtual Domino City arcade where the real exit is. He takes possession of Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body (given that he defeated him before) and escapes to the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing right through Noah&amp;rsquo;s mind games, Kaiba heads through the streets of Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s virtual Domino City for Kaiba Corporation and finds his biological father in the President&amp;rsquo;s office. He orders Gozaburo to shut down this virtual world and release everyone, but he replies that Seto must earn his freedom and challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/#ep-57---gozaburo-vs-kaiba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. To remind his adoptive son of the painful moment he&amp;rsquo;d experienced when he dueled Yugi, who&amp;rsquo;d achieved the impossible by summoning Exodia in their first duel, Gozaburo reveals that he is using an Exodia Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Yugi and his friends are fighting an army of duel monsters. Noah has escaped to the real world in Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body and moves towards Seto&amp;rsquo;s pod, planning to unplug it right and there to kill him. But he suddenly has a change of heart when he remembers the way Mokuba considered Noah his brother during their duel, despite the way he had been treated. Noah rushes back to try to help everyone escape, pointing to the location of the exit door, as the duel monsters keep spawning and start to become an insurmountable threat to the gang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group manage to escape to the real world thanks to Noah, and luckily Honda wakes up in his real body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba wins his duel, and when Gozaburo turns into a red monster and tries to escape in Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s body by force, he activates a small device he has brought with him to this virtual world, one that starts to delete everything from the inside. Noah, in Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body, climbs back inside the pod and reenters the virtual world. He returns his body back to Mokuba and the two say goodbye as Noah sends Mokuba back to the real world. Noah then traps Gozaburo, saving Seto, and as the place selfdestructs, Kaiba makes his escape.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back at the museum the group gets out of the pods and find that Rebecca and her grandfather are also there. Sugoroku had called them in after the machines malfunctioned. Rebecca, a genius with computers, was able to eventually monitor them inside the virtual world and was trying to find a way for them to exit safely but they beat her to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s friend who works at the museum) ensures that the room is locked out from other visitors and states that they will need to get in contact with Kaiba Corporation to ensure it is safe before opening it to the public. Suddenly, Mokuba himself gets in contact with him on the phone and says that they will be taking the pods out of there for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all start talking about what happened in the virtual world with Rebecca and the others. After a while, Arthur explains that he actually came to the city to see this exhibition in the first place, to which Yoshimori replies that he considers it a great honor given that Arthur is a world renowned archaeologist, known for being the one who discovered a year ago what is rumoured to be Atlantis (a claim that is still in dispute, but impressive nonetheless). Yoshimori also mentions that Ms. Ishizu will be coming soon to the city with some really important pieces of the exhibition, and that they should not miss a second visit once she arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Kanekura (the curator of the museum) is shown to be interested in the Millennium Puzzle and is watching them from afar with another man. The man thinks the Millennium Puzzle looks great and wants to buy it, Kanekura whispers to the man that they&amp;rsquo;ll do business in his office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A man (Shadi) is shown walking through the city, invisible and intangible. A bit of a flashback is shown from him, and an internal monolog about him seeing Pegasus in a coma on a hospital bed, with his Millennium Eye removed, and completely unresponsive. He regrets failing to find his attacker. He arrives at the museum and at the very same moment that group is walking outside, thanking Yoshimori for the visit and saying goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadi (invisible to all) sees Yugi and his Millennium Puzzle in the distance and believes that&amp;rsquo;s fate that they have met there once again. But first he has something else to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kanekura is in his office when suddenly Shadi shows up and judges him with the Millennium Scale. They &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a mind puzzle game, a Shadow Game, and Shadi finds him guilty of greed, evil thoughts and attempting to cash on egyptian relics, the judgment is death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following day after school, on the TV, Sugoroku and Yugi hear about reporters on the museum talking about the curator&amp;rsquo;s death. They say it was apparently a heart attack but people are already talking about an egyptian curse. Sugoroku wants to go see Yoshimori at the University since this must be hard for him, but he can&amp;rsquo;t close his store just yet because he is waiting an important delivery of games, so he asks Yugi if he can go see him now that the school is over. He says that he will join him later as soon as he can receive the delivery. Sugoroku calls Yoshimori to let him know in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi leaves the store and bumps into Anzu and Jonouchi who have just heard the news of Kanekura&amp;rsquo;s death. Jonouchi is certain this is a curse and wants to go with them to see Yoshimori since the Professor was nice to them the other day and they are all worried about him. They quickly call Honda but he is stuck at school with club activities so he apologizes he can’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Shadi shows up to Yoshimori at his office and uses his Millennium Key (also known as Millennium Ankh) to look into his mind before judging him with the Scales. In his mind he sees that his heart is cluttered with obsessions from the past and that he neglected his family for his job. He also briefly sees Yoshimori’s brother dying by falling out of a window. The darkness of the room represents the anxiety and fear of death given the recent events, but he also sees hope. That hope is represented by Sugoroku and the group going there. Shadi is once again surprised to see Yugi present and decides that before killing this man he will use him to properly test Yugi, as he will face harder challenges in the future, specially from the one who stole the millennium eye and is still on the loose. Shadi redecorates Yoshimori&amp;rsquo;s soul room, turning him into a zombie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi, Jonouchi and Anzu get to the University and meet with Yoshimori but he starts attacking them. Yugi is surprised to see Shadi appear in the professor’s office but he seems to be the only one who can see him. When it looks like Jonouchi is overpowering Yoshimori, Shadi brainwash Anzu and makes her go running to the roof. Yugi runs after her but cant catch her. When he gets to the roof she is already on the trap Shadi made for her, so they both &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in their minds with the power of their millennium items, while still being aware of their surroundings in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Jonouchi escapes through a window from the demented professor and climbs up, where he sees Anzu. He tries to save her and they do it when Yugi defeats Shadi and the ankh clears Anzu mind. The professor climbed through the window after Jonouchi but the boy places the Ankh upon him and he is too released from the soul&amp;rsquo;s redecoration, coming back to himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defeated, Shadi leaves and mutters to himself that he is now sure without a doubt not only that Yugi is the proper holder of the Millennium Puzzle, but that he is stronger than what he initially thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all go back to the professor&amp;rsquo;s office and after being sure that he is okay they go to the university&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria to buy something to eat or drink, while the professor stays on his office resting for a bit from the crazy incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking advantage that Yugi and his friends are temporarily absent, Shadi appears once again and tells Yoshimori that he still needs to be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;judged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, rising the scales upon him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku is walking down the street, finally getting to the University building when there is a sound of glass shattering. He sees his friend Yoshimori falling through the window and screams in horror. Shadi looks to the professor in the ground one last time and leaves, disappearing in the air. The silhouette of a young girl is shown in the door behind where Shadi just was, covering her mouth in horror after seeing what just happened there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group visit Yoshimori at the hospital and meet his wife, young son and niece. The niece, who is the same girl that saw what Shadi did to his uncle, and goes by the name of Fizdis, stares at Yugi&amp;rsquo;s millennium puzzle but says nothing. Yoshimori is out of danger but he is in a coma and he may never wake up. While leaving, Yugi wonders why Shadi&amp;rsquo;s method are so drastic and is unsure if its friend or foe, convinced that it was him who attacked Yoshimori when they were absent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of days later Ishizu arrives to the city and starts making the final preparations for her egyptian exhibition. Shortly after she gives a press conference on TV about the museum, while also briefly mentioning the unfortunate events that occured there recently. She hopes for the best recovery for the professor and also encourage people to come visit, as its a one-in-a-lifetime experience to see all these relics for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shown walking on the streets. Anzu sees and calls him but he doesnt hear her. She stumbles upon a store with tv screens that is transmitting Ishizu&amp;rsquo;s conference, and is interested in her. Mokuba is also watching the conference in his place too, and mentions it to Seto, who doesnt care. At that very moment Ishizu herself personally calls Seto on the phone and invites him to meet with her at the Museum, with the promise of finding some rare cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba and Ishizu meet at the Museum at night and she shows him an interesting tablet which surprises him. Ishizu uses the powers of her Millennium Necklace (also known as Millennium Tauk) to show him a vision of the past, of Ancient Egypt and of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; between a priest and a servant of the Pharaoh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She then talks about the Ghouls and the God Cards, explaining what they are and what’s her true goal in the city. She gives Kaiba “The Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk” and instructs him on creating a tournament so that the other two Egyptian Gods can be found. She also states she will entrust Kaiba with &amp;ldquo;Obelisk&amp;rdquo; for the tournament but that he will give it to her back. When he asks why would she trusts him that much she just says that she does. Kaiba leaves the place not caring that much for the egyptian stuff, but laughing about having obtained such a powerful card and getting excited about the prospect of the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi has exchanged the brown rope for a chain in order to keep his Millennium Puzzle as safe as possible. His other self explains that this change is vital since the Millennium Puzzle connects the two, and he also senses that fate has more in store for them, specially after Shadi&amp;rsquo;s recent moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later that day Yugi and Anzu come across a fortune teller who Yugi believes can help him see what is in the future for him. The fortune teller asks for a personal item and suggest the Millennium Puzzle which, once in hand, he steals it. Yugi runs after him and Anzu go asking for help. She runs into Bakura and explain the situation, and then keeps running looking for Jonouchi and Honda. Bakura (once alone) uses his Millennium Ring to look after the Millennium Puzzle saying that Yugi must be the one that holds the puzzle, and that anyone who makes themselves his enemy become Bakura’s enemy as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi follows some arrows on the walls in the street and catches to the fortune teller in an old building that unexpectedly has a Duel Ring in it. The Millennium Puzzle has been locked to the duel ring and the fortune teller challenges Yugi to a duel. Even if they are apart Yugi and the other Yugi (that resides in the Puzzle) can still comunicate, but he says that he must not use the power of the puzzle since he feels that there is something strange, someone else besides this man trying to find his true identity. Yugi must have this duel alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Bakura found the track and starts swapping the arrow signs to confuse anyone else following him. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; starts, and Yugi notices that the fortune teller has a lot of machine cards. He guesses that he is Bandit Keith, and is right, but Keith is now the host of someone else that is controlling his mind: Marik Ishtar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Anzu finds Honda and Jonouchi and they go searching for Yugi but get confused by the arrows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura watches the duel for a bit and senses that another millennium item is in play. He uses his ring to break Marik’s control. Keith is free for a moment and resists when Marik’s tries to regain control of him. Marik feels that his power is decreasing with every moment. Keith believes that all of this is because of the millennium puzzle so he smashes it to pieces. Bakura jumps and knocks Keith out. He and Yugi gather the millennium pieces and Bakura uses his power to seal a part of himself inside a piece of the puzzle. He then leaves lying that he’ll try to find Anzu and the rest to tell them that Yugi is safe, in reality his mission was completed when he manipulated the puzzle so he has no interest in searching for the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi stays a while because he can’t pull the puzzle out of the arena. Suddenly, Keith wakes up and when Marik tries to control his mind again (with some of the small control he still has, that is still rapidly dwindling) he starts smashing everything around him, knocking some fuel and starting a fire. Yugi tries to get the Puzzle out but he cant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fire is extending quickly and Jonouchi and the rest see the smoke from a distance and follow it to the building. Anzu goes asking for help once again and Jonouchi and Honda brute force the entry. Keith runs past them escaping from the fire. They find Yugi meddling with the puzzle pieces and actually completing it once again before passing out. They try to get the puzzle out and cant, but they hear the voice of the other yugi suggesting to pull the chain with the pipes and they do, saving Yugi and the puzzle from the fire, just as firefighters arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, Yugi is shown on a hospital bed recovering from the fire and talking with his friends about the puzzle. Anzu goes to bring the others a drink and ponders about the existence of the other Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A few days later, at school, Jonouchi triumphally &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;defeats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Otogi with his own deck and makes a little dance. Yugi asks Otogi about his contact with Pegasus, and he tells him that he is in contact with a representant, not Pegasus directly, but everything appears to be going well. The game is expanding worldwide and there are multiple companies making contracts to create their own cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shown at home at night, with the puzzle, pondering about what happened with Keith. He talks with his other self about it. At the same time Anzu falls sleep on her desks and has a dream about the other Yugi in an egyptian building, before waking up startled. Back to Yugi, he asks his other self who he is and they both talk about it. Yugi doesnt want to part ways with him though, and cries a bit about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following day, Honda and Jonouchi are at school talking about the upcoming Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s operation. Yugi asks Anzu if she is free that weekend to hang out with the other Yugi, and he sets the date for that sunday at domino station at 10 in the morning as he runs into the rain covering his head with his school bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tricked by his other half, the other Yugi is a bit awkward at first but then he relax and spends a fun day with Anzu. At one point, while drinking something, she asks if he wants to go to the egyptian museum now that it has all the stuff they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see before. He is a bit reticent to this at first. They hang out the entire day, go to the park, see a movie, and buy some card packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They end up meeting a guy named Johnny Steps on a dance video machine and Anzu beats him dancing. He then goes after them and challenge them in “a real game”: duel monsters. Yugi is ready to accept but Anzu accepts for him, saying that she has been practicing a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and yugi is surprised to see that Anzu holds her up pretty well against him, specially seeing that he’s not a bad duelist at all. At one point she takes a considerable advantage and is about to beat him, so she thanks Yugi for an encouraging comment he gave her. Hearing his name and finally figuring out his looks, Johnny realizes who he is and bails from the duel. But Anzu stops him when he&amp;rsquo;s running away and talks a bit with him, helping reignite his dream on being a dancer and motivating him to keep pushing for his dream and not give up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing that and seeing how she dueled, the other Yugi says that he is ready to see what the Museum may hold for him.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The night has fallen. Anzu and Yugi go into the Museum and find the old stone tablet depicting a battle between a Pharaoh and a high-ranking Priest: One looks like Yugi while the other looks like Kaiba. They meet Ishizu who gives Yugi some clues about his past. She tells Yugi that, he came to the Museum of his own will and, in doing so, has chosen the &amp;ldquo;Fate of Fighting&amp;rdquo;. If he wants to get his memories back, there&amp;rsquo;s no other choice but to gather the 7 Millennium Items. Yugi, suspicious, questions on which side is she.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She challenges him to a mental &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using her Millennium Necklace. They have a short mind duel, while Anzu is unaware of what is happening, as the time for them goes way faster because they are dueling with their minds. Ishizu makes some impressive moves on her turn, but quickly surrenders after that, explaining that she has seen how this duel would play out. She calmly replies that she isn&amp;rsquo;t Yugi’s foe, but that she can see a man wielding a new Millennium Item who will show up soon enough in front of Yugi. She adds that Yugi’s battle is for the sake of gaining his memories back and that his Fate will be set in motion soon enough. The rest is for Yugi to confirm with his own eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She briefly uses the power of her Millennium Necklace to give both Yugi and Anzu a small vision (much shorter than Kaiba), but in this case a vision of the future: of Yugi fighting a dangerous opponent, and of the millennium rod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu excuses herself after this, and leaves for the moment. She has an internal monolog about how relieved she feels on finally finding the one her family was looking for so long, but also concerned about what will happen next, now that fate is in motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba has just tested in a duel against his Duel Computer the new Egyptian God card for the first time and is pleasently surprised by its power when it defeats the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (the duel is not shown, only the ultimate dragon being destroyed and Kaiba laughing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Yugi and Anzu leave the museum they walk around for a bit and meet with Mai in front of the domino station. She has shown up for the announcement for the upcoming tournament (and jokingly teases Anzu for being on a date with Yugi). The three of them talk for a bit and spot around other familiar duelists that are near (including Kajiki, Haga, Ryuzaki and many others). Suddenly Kaiba takes control of every television screen in the city and announces his new Battle City tournament, which will start in exactly one week (the following sunday). An ante rule will be present for the rarest card of each deck, and duelists must have the new Duel Disks to enter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming aware of this tournament, the holder of the Millennium Rod and leader of the Ghouls sends his Rare Hunters out to Duel and win Rare Cards for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following morning after the announcement of Battle City, Bakura appears in front of the Domino Museum. He is being guided by his Millennium Ring which is sensing a millennium item in the proximity. He enters the museum and after walking for a bit sees the ancient stone tablet. Ishizu appears before him and confronts him. Bakura is surprised to know that she’s a millennium item holder, revealing that his host’s father is the actual owner of the museum, much to Ishizu’s surprise. They both face in a mind &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with their respective millennium items. The duel ends up being relatively even, with no one being able to get past the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly, Shadi shows up and interrupts their mind duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-65---clash-of-the-millennium-items&#34;&gt;Episode 65 - Clash of the Millennium Items!

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadi has interrupted the duel between Bakura and Ishizu by showing himself and breaking their mental connection. Ishizu is surprised to see him here, and Bakura too. Shadi confronts Bakura accusing him of stealing Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Millennium Eye, which Bakura confirms laughing maniacally and fully retelling them their mind &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (two duels actually, first on episode 28 that Bakura lost but used his power to erase Pegasus&amp;rsquo; memory of it, and then on episode 40 that bakura won).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also confirms in front of Ishizu that he killed Shadi with his own hands years ago, and that he has no problem facing him now as a ghost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura states that he is searching for all the millennium items, and points that he still needs the Scale and Ankh as well. Him and Shadi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-museum-arc/&#34; &gt;face each other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a flash of light with their millennium items (Ankh vs Ring). Ishizu runs away in the middle of the bright light and conceals her presence using the Millennium Tauk, saying that she should use it as little as possible now due to there being such a powerful antagonist near her. After the clash, Shadi vanishes too and Bakura mumbles in frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura, weakened after those two exchanges, looks into the ancient tablet one final time and retreats saying that he needs to gather strength as he has the feeling something interesting is going to happen in the upcoming days. In his place, the real Bakura recovers control of his own body and wonder what is he doing there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu is last seen leaving the museum, as she doesn’t feel safe there. Shadi is last seen in a different place, admitting that he cannot defeat Bakura as he is now, and looking at the Scales and the Ankh pondering why he can’t extract their full powers against other millennium items holders, wondering if he’s not worthy anymore now that he’s dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yugi and his friends travel to the Duelist Kingdom island and challenge Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters, in order to recover the soul of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My goal with this arc was to recreate it faithfully within the Kingdom Duels ruleset. Therefore, no actual changes were made in the narrative on this particular arc. The 40 episodes are replicated here as precisely as they were in the original japanese run of the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A narrator explains how in Ancient Egypt, when the pyramids were young, ancient Kings played Shadow Games, which erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the world. However a Pharaoh sealed the magic away, imprisoning it in the Millennium Items. Thousands of years later Yugi Muto unlocked the secrets of the Millennium Puzzle infusing him with ancient magical energies. Destiny has chosen Yugi to prevent the return of the Shadow Games, just like the Pharaoh did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Domino High School, Yugi is teaching his friend, Jonouchi, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---yugi-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;how&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to play Duel Monsters, while Honda, Anzu and Bakura watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi takes his friends to see Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s (his grandfather) shop. The old man reveals that he has an ultra rare card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kaiba, a rich kid from school who overheard them talking about it, arrives to the place too and attempts to purchase the card but Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather refuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later that night Kaiba calls Yugi asking him to come retrieve his grandfather as he is not feeling well and needs picking up. Kaiba had sent his employees to grab the old man and drag him to his place, where they dueled and he took his Blue-Eyes card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba welcomes Yugi and his friends at his company and tears apart the card he took from Sugoroku. He explains that he did it because already had 3 Blue-Eyes and didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted for the 4th one to be used against him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku leaves in an ambulance but entrust Yugi his own deck. Anzu uses a marker to draw a smiley face symbol of friendship on everyone&amp;rsquo;s hands. She says that even though the ink will wash away, they will always remember the circle of their friendship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---kaiba-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;confronts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Kaiba in an epic duel using his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s deck. Yugi is overwhelmed and cornered though, as Kaiba is an excellent duelist. Eventually the protagonist manages to draw the five legendary pieces of Exodia, which allow him to win the duel and cleanse the darkness in Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s heart using the power of his Millennium Puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elsewhere, Pegasus is informed that the uncontested champion Seto Kaiba has been defeated by someone named Yugi. Pegasus smiles and his golden left eye flashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At school Jonouchi is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---jonouchi-vs-anzu&#34; &gt;dueling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Anzu and is defeated by her quite easily. He still has a ton of room to improve so after a talk with Yugi he decides to ask for Sugoroku to train him into a better duelist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later the Duel Monster National Tournament is taking place and the group is watching the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---haga-vs-ryuzaki&#34; &gt;finals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the TV between Insector Haga and Dinosaur Ryuzaki, a matchup that ends up with Haga&amp;rsquo;s victory. Pegasus J. Crawford, creator of Duel Monsters, hands the trophy to Haga and announces a new tournament of a scale never seen before that will be taking place soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi receives a delivery package in the form of a VHS tape, a gauntlet and some other things from Industrial Illusions, the company creating Duel Monster cards. He watches the VHS which happens to be a message from Pegasus inviting him to the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly everything changes when the Pegasus from the TV freezes time and lures Yugi into a Shadow Game using the power of his Millennium Eye. They have a time-gated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-2---pegasus-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of 15 minutes and Yugi is shocked by Pegasus abilities to read his mind. In the end Yugi is about to deliver a final blow but the time limit is up and Pegasus wins. Using his powers, he seals Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s soul into a card and challenges Yugi to come and recover it by defeating him face to face in the upcoming Duelist Kingdom tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Jonouchi attend the ferry to Duelist Kingdom with Anzu and Honda who are sneaking onboard as well. Jonouchi is excited as the prospect of winning the prize money to pay for his sister Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s eye operation but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t invited to the tournament so he almost get booted by security until Yugi sees him and gives him one of his Star Chips, therefore allowing him to participate according to the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the trip, Yugi and Jonouchi meet Kujaku Mai. Anzu spots Bakura from their school and wonders what is he doing there. Mai kicks Ryuzaki out of his room when she beats him in a duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haga, the national champion, meets Yugi and tricks him into letting him see the Exodia pieces. In a surprise twist, he throws them overboard. Jonouchi jumps in the water after them. Yugi jumps in to help Jonouchi when he struggles to keep swimming and Anzu throws a rope ladder for them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi is upset that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find Yugi&amp;rsquo;s cards. He talks about Shizuka who is going blind and the tournament prize money would pay for an operation to fix her eyesight. The four of them decide look into the sunrise as the island approaches in the distance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The group starts wandering around and Yugi finds Haga. They begin an all-or-nothing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-4-5---haga-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as Yugi wants payoff for what happened to the Exodia cards. It is now revealed that there are Duel Arenas scattered across the island and that the terrains they are placed on give different powerups to different monsters.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi takes up this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-6---mai-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and although is outmatched and confused by her aroma tactics, he ends up pulling the shocking win thanks to the Time Wizard card he got from Yugi as a gift during the ferry.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After finding out that Yugi, the one who beat Kaiba, is among them, Kajiki invites them to eat and later challenges Yugi to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-7---kajiki-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using his powerful ocean monsters that hide beneath the water.

&lt;li&gt;Mokuba challenges Yugi to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-8---mokuba-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but he is no match and abandons the duel in an attempt to steal some Star Chips from Yugi, trying to get him disqualified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They end up catching him and convincing him to return the stars to their rightfull owner, but when he does it the tournament official, Saruwatari, throws the Star Chips to the ocean and grabs him. Yugi challenge him to a duel and he arranges a duel&amp;hellip; but with a different opponent. It seems that opponent is no other than the spirit of the now-defunct Seto Kaiba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The group is still in shock on how that person looks and acts exactly like the real Kaiba, and even has his own deck. Yugi is quickly cornered by his powerful monsters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere else, the real Kaiba, who was attacked by Pegasus goons and had to flee the scene leaving his Deck behind, manages to get to a hidden Kaiba Corporation computer server. From there he launches an offensive trying to put a stop on Pegasus machinations, who is plotting to get rid of him and take over his company.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Kaiba hacks into Industrial Illusions servers and finds that Yugi is having a duel against &amp;ldquo;himself&amp;rdquo;. He sends a virus trying to destroy the Blue-Eyes card but is stopped by Pegasus&amp;rsquo; cybersecurity mid-way. Someway, however, his bond with his own card manages to destroy the Blue-Eyes White Dragon used by the fake Kaiba, which gives Yugi a fighting chance. As Pegasus hencheman find Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s location he has to flee the scene once again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the actual &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-9-10---impersonator-of-death-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Yugi manages to fend-off the attacks with the help of the real Kaiba. The impersonator finally reveals himself as who he actually is and the duel concludes with a clever comeback by Yugi. In the end, Yugi focuses his rage towards Pegasus who is watching everything unfold through a monitor, smiling in anticipation for their upcoming duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the group looks around, Mokuba and Saruwatari are missing.&lt;/li&gt;

When Dinosaur Ryuzaki challenges her as payback for what happened on the ferry, she says she will take him on, but only if he beats Jonouchi first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryuzaki then finds and challenges Jonouchi to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-11-12---ryuzaki-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in which his experience proves to be overbearing for the newbie duelist. As he manages to hold Ryuzaki&amp;rsquo;s attacks, Jonouchi plays a pair of Battleguard cards that are a representation of the bond that he and Honda have, managing to turn the tide of the duel.&lt;/li&gt;

Suddenly Ryuzaki plays his best card, the Red-Eyes Black Dragon, which turns the tide in his favour once again. Feeling confident, Ryuzaki convince Jonouchi to bet their rarest cards in this duel. A miracle play with the Time Wizard is barely enough to give Jonouchi the surprising win and also the Red-Eyes card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When nighttime falls the gang decides to set up camp. They are exhausted and hungry. Suddenly Mai shows up with a sack full of food. They get to talk and know eachother better. Later, Mai goes on a walk nearby and is kidnapped by a large man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the campfire, Bakura (a friend from school) appears and the group welcome him to sit down, asking how he got there to the island and what is he doing there. They get to talk about Duel Monsters and all of them show their favourite cards. Bakura states that he wants a duel with Yugi, not for star chips but just for fun, and suggest that they should all put their favourite cards in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they are about to duel a mysterious power shines on and the Millennium Ring appears at Bakura&amp;rsquo;s neck. Everyone passes out due to his magic. As he reaches for Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle, the-other-Yugi appears and says that if he wants his Puzzle, he has to duel him for it, but if Yugi wins, Bakura must restore the souls of his friends. Bakura accepts, but warns him that this is one game he will not win.&lt;/li&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s a Shadow Game in where the gang takes the form of their corresponding favorite cards. The other Yugi is worried because the soul of their friends are at stake, and duels carefully while Bakura is trying to send the cards to the Graveyard so their souls can be consumed by the reaper of the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also the first time that the rest of the group sees the two Yugi side by side and interact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end they all manage to work together and defeat the evil spirit inside the Millennium Ring, with the help of the real Bakura that bought enough time to let the-other-Yugi to finish the duel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mai just had lost a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-14---panik-vs-mai&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; against an eliminator named Panik, and is forced to give up all her Star Chips, and therefore she is eliminated from Duelist Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group arrives and see what is happening. Yugi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-14-15---panik-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Panik betting all his star chips to try to recover the ones Mai lost, and the two duelists enter an arena in which the darkness and the night give the eliminator a huge advantage. Yugi is not intimidated by Panik, he stays confident and mocks his opponent repeatedly, as the duel grows more difficult moment by moment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After the duel, Yugi offers Mai her Star Chips back, but Mai refuses to take them as she believes she does not deserve them. After Jonouchi plays around and tries to steal the chips, Mai demands that he give them back, and he does. As Yugi and the group leave, Mai thanks Yugi for his effort, saying that when they meet again, she will repay him and face him in an honorable duel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pegasus is in his office talking with the Big Five about their deal to take over Kaiba Corporation, which will require from Pegasus to beat Yugi in a duel to clear Kaiba Corporation&amp;rsquo;s name after Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s defeat at the hands of the young duelist. The Big Five are the board of Kaiba Corporation and want Kaiba removed from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Seto Kaiba arrives in a helicopter to the Duelist Kingdom island in search of Mokuba and encounters Yugi and the group. Yugi returns Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s deck to him (as he had been holding on to it after defeating the impersonator) and Kaiba thanks him. They talk about defeating Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi is angered by Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s attitude and challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-16---kaiba-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which Kaiba accepts as he wants to try out his new Duel Disk system he&amp;rsquo;s been working on. Jonouchi is no match for Kaiba and gets stomped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba then tells them about Pegasus&amp;rsquo; mysterious powers. Sometime ago at the United States, Kaiba himself was one of Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s guests of honor in a tournament. In the final round, Pegasus was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-16---keith-vs-pegasustom&#34; &gt;dueling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a man named Bandit Keith. Pegasus just played with Keith, then wrote something on a piece of paper and called a kid from the audience. With that paper the kid managed to beat Keith in a single turn, to Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Kaiba may not agree on most things, but they both know that Pegasus must be stopped. Kaiba leaves the group and heads for the Pegasus&amp;rsquo; castle, unaware that Pegasus is watching him with his Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The next morning Anzu shows up with Mai&amp;rsquo;s backpack. Mai left the group, but wrote Yugi a note saying she owes him eight Star Chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the gang walk through the woods, they are being spied on by three boys: Kotsuzuka, Takaido, and Satake, who all work for Bandit Keith. Keith sneaked into the Duelist Kingdom tournament to get revenge on Pegasus for what he did to him in New York City. The three spies know Yugi was the kid who defeated Seto Kaiba months earlier, so they decide to eliminate Jonouchi first. Jonouchi, wanting to go to the bathroom, splits a bit from his group but Takaido and Satake follow him and knock him unconscious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi wakes up in a cave where a Graveyard field is located. In there he begins a spooky &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-17-18---kotsuzuka-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; against Kotsuzuka and his Zombie monsters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the group find Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s wallet, leading them to investigate a nearby cave.&lt;/li&gt;

After being overwhelmed by the indestructible zombies, Jonouchi manages to swap them into defense and destroy them for good, winning the duel. He now has eight Star Chips, meaning he only needs two more to become a finalist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the group approaches the cave&amp;rsquo;s exit, Keith&amp;rsquo;s gang blocks the entrance with a large boulder, too heavy for any of them to budge. As punishment for losing, Keith beats up his henchmen and takes all of their Star Chips, getting a total of ten. Though this was not what he originally planned, it&amp;rsquo;s still fine by him, and he strides off alone, ready to enter Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Following where the ring points, they end up at a large Dueling Arena, where the Meikyu Brothers appear, challenging them to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-19-21---brother-kyu--brother-mei-vs-yugi--jonouchi&#34; &gt;tag duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Yugi and Jonouchi bet six Star Chips between them, enough to gain them entrance to Pegasus Castle if they win. But first they must get pass the eliminators and their unique field: the Labyrinth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Mokuba, trapped in Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s underground prison, is thinking about his brother Seto and what happened to them when they were younger. Kaiba, on the other hand, is outside, approaching Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, as Seto Kaiba approaches Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle, he is confronted by Saruwatari, but Kaiba overpowers him and takes him hostage, demanding that he take him to Mokuba.

&lt;li&gt;In Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s dungeon, Kaiba finds Mokuba but is soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to lock Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s soul in a card. He throws some star chips at Kaiba and tells him that if he wants to see Mokuba again, he must defeat Yugi first.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the group emerge from the underground tunnel and arrive outside Pegasus Castle. Anzu thinks about how Yugi often switches from a gentle and caring nature to a more forceful, slightly colder and unfriendlier one. She concludes there must be two Yugis after remembering his Duel with Bakura.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She then recalls some time ago when she was working part-time at Burger World and she feared that Yugi and Jonouchi would reveal this to the school when they visited one day (as it was against the school rules to have a part-timme job). She admitted she was working there to raise money to travel to New York to study dance, and was shocked to find they were encouraging her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a pervert mugger with a camera, and was knocked out unconscious for a moment. She was rescued by Yugi who challenged the mugger with Duel Monster cards and Mind Crushed him. Although she was a bit hazy she remembered the confident attitude of Yugi at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the group climb up the stairs to Pegasus Castle they encounter Kaiba, who challenges Yugi. Yugi accepts and they begin their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-22-24---kaiba-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on an open area atop the castle using Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s new-and-improved Duel Disks. Bandit Keith arrives at the castle in time to watch, but he stays out of view of the others.&lt;/li&gt;

The situation seems hopeless for Yugi, but encouragement from his friends and thoughts of his grandpa make him determined to carry on.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Despite being at the mercy of Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s fused dragon, Yugi forms a crazy counter defense while also jeopardizing his opponent monster, turning the tide completely. Kaiba becomes distressed as he knows he is going to lose the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-22-24---kaiba-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the fate of Mokuba is also in the balance for him. Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Elf Swordsman cuts off one of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s head, and another attack will defeat Kaiba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle battlements. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the force of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him. Kaiba resurrects the dragon head that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi&amp;rsquo;s monster and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move, otherwise he will fall to his death. Yugi and his other self have a conflict over risking Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s life for his grandpa. The-other-Yugi launches the attack anyway, but Anzu runs to him pleading to call off the attack. Yugi regains control of his body and stops the attack just in time. Kaiba then declares an attack and wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is frightened of his other self, who was willing to kill in order to win. He drops to his knees and begins to sob. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi on his weakness, but Anzu tearfully scolds him, saying that he bet his &amp;ldquo;chip of life&amp;rdquo; like it was nothing and that he is the true loser because Yugi was willing to protect Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s own life despite the outcome of the duel. Kaiba leaves, having no comeback to her words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shocked about what happened and won&amp;rsquo;t respond to his friends, even when Jonouchi offers his star chips to him. Mai shows up and offer him the Star Chips that she owed him, stating that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find all 8 but she has 6, which would be enough for him to enter the castle. But Yugi has no response. Exasperated, she challenges him to a duel for the chips but Anzu decides to take his place to everyone&amp;rsquo;s shock.&lt;/li&gt;

But at some point Anzu manages to use a combination to destroy Mai&amp;rsquo;s Harpie Lady. Mai was about to activate a response but decides not to, and forfeits the duel after that. Yugi snaps out of it during the duel, seeing Anzu dueling for him. He ends up accepting Mai&amp;rsquo;s Star Chips and everyone heads towards the castle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mr. Crocketts comes in and greets the finalists telling them there will be an exhibition match for them between Seto Kaiba and Pegasus himself. Kaiba wants Pegasus to duel with his Duel Disks but Pegasus says if they use them, the now soul-less Mokuba will operate his for him. Kaiba, not wanting to duel his own little brother, decides to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-26-27---pegasus-vs-kaiba&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a normal Dueling Arena instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battle starts and Pegasus uses his power to get a clear advantage of his opponent.&lt;/li&gt;

He unleash his powerful Toon monsters against him, and although Kaiba puts up a valiant fight, in the end he is defeated by a reverse combo in which Pegasus uses Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s own virus card to destroy his entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duel, Pegasus seals Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s soul inside a card. Yugi, both saddened and angry after everything that happened, challenges Pegasus. He responds that if he wish to duel him he has to win the tournament first.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is the evening before the Duelist Kingdom finals and everyone in the castle is having dinner in the dining hall. During the feast, the pairings of Duelists in the Finals are determined. First, Yugi will face Mai, and then Jonouchi will duel Keith. Unfortunately, Jonouchi and Keith do not have either of the required tournament entry cards. Yugi gives his friend the &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Hand&amp;rdquo; entry card for him to use the prize money for his sister&amp;rsquo;s eye operation. Meanwhile, Keith schemes to find another way to get one of the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the dinner, everyone splits and heads to their designated bedrooms. Mai is planning her strategy for the duel. Jonouchi is asleep in his room, dreaming and talking out loud when Keith sneaks in and steals his tournament entry card. Yugi is asleep and has a dream with his grandpa and the Kaiba brothers cards in tombstones, speaking to him asking for his help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda suspects that Pegasus cheated in his duel against Kaiba and brings Anzu and Bakura to inspect the Dueling Arena. They find a hole that shines moonlight directly at the arena. Looking through the hole, Honda sees a tower on the other side of the courtyard and suspects that one of Pegasus&amp;rsquo; henchmen may have being spying on Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s hand using a telescope. The three climb into the tower using a grappling hook. Inside, they inspect the room and find nothing but a painting of a woman. They are soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three wake up in a passageway filled with Egyptian murals and paintings. They enter a room, where two robed men are facing each other while others behind them are chanting. The two robed men reveal stone tablets to each other. One contains a carving of a &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; while the other has a &amp;ldquo;Crawling Dragon&amp;rdquo;. The robed man with &amp;ldquo;Crawling Dragon&amp;rdquo; loses and is consumed in green flames, as his monster was weaker than &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo;. Honda, Anzu and Bakura unintentionally make some noice seeing this, causing the robed men to notice them and surround them. The winning man reveals himself to be Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus reveals that the game he just played was one of the Shadow Games that took place in ancient Egypt, an ancient ritual where one&amp;rsquo;s very being is put to the test. He reads Anzu and Honda&amp;rsquo;s minds, to their shock, and explains what his Millennium Eye can do. When he tries to do the same to Bakura, his Millennium Ring appears and the evil Bakura takes over Bakura&amp;rsquo;s body. Pegasus is absolutely surprised about this. Then, their Millennium Items clash in a powerful beam of light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honda and Anzu appear back in their rooms, feeling that what just had happened was a dream. In his own room, the other Bakura is happy that he has finally found the Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;

Losing her most powerful monster and not willing to watch her Harpie Ladies be destroyed, Mai surrenders.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The second duel of the semifinals between Keith and Jonouchi is about to begin. When Mr. Crocketts asks both contestants to show their tournament entry cards, Keith shows the one he took from Jonouchi. So naturally, when Jonouchi reaches for his, he can&amp;rsquo;t find it. He has five minutes to find that card or he will be disqualified. Jonouchi searches all over his room for it, but to no avail. He is just about to give up when Mai comes in and gives him her card. He arrives at the Dueling Arena just in the nick of time and presents Mai&amp;rsquo;s card, to Keith&amp;rsquo;s shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-31-32---keith-vs-jonouchi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; between them begins, and Keith takes the advantage with his machine monsters which are immune to magic attacks. He is far more experienced and after dealing with some of Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s cards he launches a final attack&amp;hellip; which gets stopped by Jonouchi. The duel then turns into a neck-to-neck battle, proving how much Jonouchi has learned in the island.&lt;/li&gt;

He ends up making a crazy move though, summoning his Red-Eyes Black Dragon and using Keith own cards against him. At some point Keith has to actually cheat by pulling cards to his hand in order to re-take the advantage, but even then Jonouchi manages to find a path and deal the finishing blow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keith, refusing to accept defeat, demands the Duel be declared invalid since Joey used Mai&amp;rsquo;s card. Jonouchi admits this is true and asks how he could have known that. Pegasus, at this point declares that Keith stole Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s card, and that he personally doesn&amp;rsquo;t care much about which card they are holding, but he cannot condone how he cheated during the duel. Pegasus orders his guards to take Keith away, but Keith knocks them out cold, jumps towards Pegasus, and points a gun to his head, demanding the prize money. Pegasus mocks Keith and activates a trap door on the ground, sending Keith through a tunnel and out into the ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Jonouchi being the winner, he now has to face Yugi in the final duel of the tournament to decide the one that will face Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi starts strong and gets the upper hand, baiting some plays from Yugi and managing to summon Black Demons Dragon fusing monsters from both of them.&lt;/li&gt;

Jonouchi ends up using his Time Wizard to empower his Baby Dragon into Thousand Dragon, but this also triggers Yugi&amp;rsquo;s own Dark Magician who becomes an older and more experienced version of itself. With tears in their eyes, Yugi resurrects Black Demons Dragon to finish the duel. He is the winner of Duelist Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, Jonouchi tries to give him his &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Right Hand&amp;rdquo;, but Yugi tells him to keep it since Jonouchi needs the money more than he does and Yugi is only there to rescue his grandfather. With the Duel over, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the ultimate showdown between Yugi and Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The final Duel of Duelist Kingdom is about to begin. Yugi will face Pegasus for the release of his grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba. The Big Five are watching the Duel, knowing that if Pegasus wins, Kaiba Corporation is his. Before the duel starts, Mr. Crocketts asks Yugi to show the &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Left Hand&amp;rdquo; card to challenge the king, which he does. He explains that if he wins he will get 60% of Industrial Illusion&amp;rsquo;s stocks (in other words, if he wishes it, he will become the new president of Industrial Illusions). Pegasus then says that on the other hand, if Yugi loses the duel, he will be trapped in a card like the others.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda, believing Pegasus is up to something, runs off to the castle&amp;rsquo;s dungeon to find the bodies of the Kaiba brothers. He wanders around the dungeon until he finds Mokuba. Unfortunately, unlocking his cell door triggered a silent alarm, forcing him to flee while the guards hunt him down.&lt;/li&gt;

Yugi knows from Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Duel with Kaiba that this is a very powerful card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Bakura, under the control of his evil self Bakura, leaves the group to search for Honda. He finds him with Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body and being cornered by two guards. Bakura uses &amp;ldquo;Chains of Magical Energy&amp;rdquo; to trap the guards (using some sort of magic to actually use the effect of a card in the real world), allowing him and Tristan to get away. However while trying to escape, they quickly reach a dead end.&lt;/li&gt;

Yugi and the-other-Yugi devise a plan to counter Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Millennium Eye by repeatedly switching control of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s body each turn using the Millennium Puzzle. They will not even tell each other what cards they place on the field, making Pegasus unable to figure out their strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Yugi destroys Pegasus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Toon World&amp;rdquo; and all of his monsters, Pegasus decides to take the duel with the utmost respect and he starts a Shadow Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda and Bakura are cornered in the dungeon, but suddenly Bakura uses &amp;ldquo;Flesh-Eating Insect&amp;rdquo; to attack Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s guards, then sending them to the Graveyard with &amp;ldquo;Metamor Pot&amp;rdquo;. Honda realizes that Bakura is really the spirit of the Millennium Ring from before, and Bakura reveals that he wants to use Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body for himself. He threatens Honda, saying that if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t give him up, he will end up like the guards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;As the evil Bakura demands Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body, Honda knocks him out, takes his Millennium Ring, and throws it off the castle into the woods. He then carries Bakura and Mokuba back to the balcony, where Jonouchi and Anzu are witnessing the beginning of the Shadow Duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact between them and Yugi has been cut off, and they cannot enter the shadow cloud - they either walk straight through it or return where they started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the shadow, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-35-39---pegasus-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; continues. The virtual simulation system from Kaiba is not working. Instead, each monster is maintained by one&amp;rsquo;s life energy, and regular Yugi cannot handle the force of the Shadow Game. The-other-Yugi takes over for a time stating that Yugi will not survive in such conditions, but Yugi convinces him to switch back to keep their Mind Shuffle strategy working. He manages to draw and set a card, but when Pegasus destroy&amp;rsquo;s his defending monster Yugi collapses. Despite his other self frantic calls, Yugi seems to be gone. This leaves just the-other-Yugi against Pegasus, who can once again read his mind and know all of his moves.&lt;/li&gt;

When Pegasus tries to read Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, the card he drew is blocked because of Anzu, Honda and Jonouchi spiritually bonding together to support Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a final epic turn, the-other-Yugi &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-35-39---pegasus-vs-yugi&#34; &gt;wins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with the help of &amp;ldquo;Magician of Black Chaos&amp;rdquo;, a card summoned thanks to the final effort of Yugi himself. Pegasus is left completely shocked at his loss, as the shadow bubble dissipates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi&amp;rsquo;s friends are overjoyed that he is okay and that he finally won the duel, but Anzu quickly reminds everyone that this is not over yet until Pegasus returns Kaiba, Mokuba, and Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather&amp;rsquo;s souls like he promised. Yugi then turns around and is shocked to see that Pegasus has disappeared. Bakura at this point wakes up and calls out to the group. Honda reveals to Bakura that he had to get rid of the Millennium Ring as it was possessing him like before and Bakura thanks him, understanding that getting rid of it was the probably the right thing to do. Bakura then tells the group he&amp;rsquo;ll keep an eye on Mokuba while the others search for Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After they leave, the Millennium Ring reappears around his neck and the evil Bakura returns. Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body is no longer of use to Bakura since Pegasus will be returning his soul, but with Pegasus weakened, Yami Bakura states it is the perfect time to take his Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having won the tournament, Yugi is now officially the King of Duelists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and his friends are running through the castle in order to find Pegasus, so that he will release all the souls that he captured like he promised. Anzu stops for a brief moment because she notices a nearby tower. She notes to her friends that she recognizes that tower as the one she thought that Honda and Bakura went up into before in a dream. She then realizes that was Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s sanctuary and what she remembered was real. Honda agrees too as the memory is coming back to him. They decide to go there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus is in his private tower and is depressed that he lost against Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle. Regardless, he is a man of his word, so he releases the souls of Sugoroku and the Kaiba brothers. Because of this all 3 wake up and regain their senses. Just then, the evil Bakura arrives and gives Pegasus an impromptu tarot reading before challenging him to a Shadow Game using their Millennium Items. Bakura easily defeats Pegasus (who&amp;rsquo;s still exhausted from his Shadow Game with Yugi), and takes his Millennium Eye. Yugi and the gang arrive to see Pegasus unconscious being carried away by his guards. They enter the tower and find Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s diary. Anzu reads from it, and it explains that as a teenager, he met a girl named Cyndia. They were true lovers, but just as they were about to be married, Cyndia got sick and died.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus traveled all over the world trying to get her back. He wound up in Egypt, where he met a man named Shadi, who gave him the Millennium Eye. Thanks to his wish asked to the Eye he got a brief vision of her. Pegasus gets the idea that using the holographic technology of Kaiba Corporation along with the power of the Millennium Items could bring Cyndia back to life. He explains in his diary that this was his reason for hosting the Duelist Kingdom tournament, but the diary ends there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi notices that there are three Soul Prison cards that are blank. That means Pegasus did release the souls of his prisoners like he had promised. As the group leaves, Shadi appears in the stairs using magic and confronts Yugi. Shadi uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, as that is the power of his item. To his surprise, he finds two chambers in his mind, one for Yugi, and the other for the-other-Yugi. While the former is a nice room full of innocence and toys, the latter is a giant maze filled with trap doors. Shadi enters through several of them before almost falling into an endless void. Luckily, the regular Yugi saves him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the chambers, Shadi and Yugi are walking alongside stone tablets that feature monsters from the actual Duel Monsters game. The &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; shows up, who is about to attack them as he thinks they are intruders. Shadi plans to use the &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; tablet below them to destroy it, but Yugi talks him out and manages to convince the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; to let him go. Shadi is shocked that Yugi was able to convince the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; that easily, given that the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; is it said to be the most loyal of the ancient Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s servants. Shadi leaves Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, believing he is the one that will save the world from chaos. Before he leaves, Shadi warns Yugi to take great care as the thief that stole the Millennium Eye will go after Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle soon.&lt;/li&gt;
