[{"content":"\n\u0026ldquo;Battle City is history and Yugi is the undisputed Duel King in possession of the three most powerful cards. But evil enemies arise from the shadows, willing to take away everything that is precious to him. Yugi and his friends will be tested like never before, in a thrilling battle that is centered on the evil counterpart of the Egyptian Gods, a series of monsters called: The Wicked Gods.\u0026rdquo;\nAuthor\u0026rsquo;s Note: First and foremost i wanted to partially adapt \u0026ldquo;Yugioh R\u0026rdquo; from the spinoff manga, an interesting story that a lot of people may not know. It was heavily adapted here so it received a lot of changes, but it gave me the opportunity to continue the story of Pegasus and also tie it pretty well with the Orichalchos storyline on the second half. In there, i wanted to streamline it and lower the scale of power/danger so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as conflicting with the original mythos. It is a thrilling story that definitely deserves a spot, so i was happy to include it. Sadly, i had to cut the Grand Championship as I didn\u0026rsquo;t had room for it and i feel that it works best in a future chapter.\nChapters\rSetting\rTimeline\rDuels\rCharacters\r← Previous Arc The Millennium Chapter Next Arc → List of Episodes\r91\r92\r93\r94\r95\r96\r97\r98\r99\r100\r101\r102\r103\r104\r105\r106\r107\r108\r109\r110\r111\r112\r113\r114\r115\rEpisode 91 - A Wicked Shadow\rThe events of Battle City have just concluded, and Yugi now owns all three Egyptian God cards. The problem is that he has become a celebrity, and a mob of duelists is waiting outside his house to challenge him for the God Cards. Jonouchi and Honda take on the task of distracting them by challenging them to duels, while he escapes with Anzu to go to school. At Kaiba Corporation, the computer system is being hacked, while screens flash \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; all around. The officers try to inform Seto Kaiba (who is in America) but the communication access lines are off. They can\u0026rsquo;t even cut power supply. A hologram of a long haired man in expensive clothes appears next to Isono, who is in charge of those Kaiba Corporation employees, and declares that Kaiba Corporation now belongs to Industrial Illusions. Back at Domino High School at the end of the day, Yugi and his friends are about to leave when all of a sudden the hacker (in a realistic hologram) starts to come out of a desk causing Jonouchi to freak out. He announces his name as Yako Tenma and that he is with Industrial Illusions. He states that he would like to challenge the current champion, Yugi, on the rooftop. Yako reveals that he is there as a projection created by Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s solid vision system and the duel begins. The battle is tense and goes back and forth. Yako is a powerful duelist, and even forces Yugi to play Osiris on the field. At that point he summons a black colored version of Osiris, to everyone\u0026rsquo;s surprise. Yako says that the card is called the \u0026ldquo;Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo;, and is one of the \u0026ldquo;Wicked Gods\u0026rdquo; created by Pegasus himself to combat the Egyptian Gods. In a flashback, we see Pegasus having tea with Yako a day before the Duelist Kingdom Tournament. Then, the flashback moves to Yako standing in Pegasus\u0026rsquo; room after the duel title, with a Duel Monsters card featuring Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s lover, Cyndia, splattered in blood. Then, Yako is right besides Pegasus bed in the hospital, asking Croquet who was responsible for this, who in turn replies that everything happened after his duel with Yugi. At that point Anzu disappears into thin air to everyone\u0026rsquo;s shock. In order for Yako\u0026rsquo;s plan to work, he captured Anzu moments ago and was using Kaiba Corporation solid vision system so that nobody would notice her absence. He says to Yugi, Jonouchi and Honda that if they ever want to see her again, they will have to come to Kaiba Corporation and duel all of Yako\u0026rsquo;s duelists in the tower. After this, he also vanishes into the air. Episode 92 - Battle at Kaiba Corporation, Start!\rAfter dueling Yako Tenma on the rooftop, Yugi, Jonouchi and Honda all rush to Kaiba Corporation headquarters to duel their way to Anzu. However, upon arrival, fog surrounds the entrance and a woman in black clothing steps forward. She introduces herself as Tilla Mook, the first card professor. She gives Yugi a \u0026ldquo;Soul Prison\u0026rdquo; card which contains Anzu\u0026rsquo;s soul. Tilla welcomes them to Kaiba Corporation and starts explaining that there are 10 Card Professors scattered throughout the block areas of the tower, each holding a security key card that they need to advance through the tower and get to Anzu. There is also a 100.000 dollar reward for defeating Yugi. Jonouchi wonders how much he is worth, and she dismisses him with a snide reply of 10 dollars. She then challenges Yugi to a duel with the ante being Anzu\u0026rsquo;s soul card for the key card they need to get into the building. Meanwhile, Yako Tenma sits in front of his monitors looking at the scene. A shadowed figure sneaks up behind him, their right hand reaching for \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo;, but without looking Yako tells them to keep their hands off his card, and they simply laugh at being recognized. They ask about Yako\u0026rsquo;s plan and asks him about why is he doing this. He replies that \u0026ldquo;Project R.A.\u0026rdquo; requires the battles to proceed, as the duel disk that the card professor wield were modified to redirect the duel energy from the strongest duelist, the wielder of the three gods, directly to the Kaiba Corporation server. The shadowy figure smirks, and it is revealed to be Bandit Keith. Yugi defeats Tilla and takes her security key. Episode 93 - To Each His Own Battle\rHonda now has a duel disk, as Jonouchi asked the reluctant Tilla if she could lend him her own Duel Disk. The three of them proceed down a hall. Upon entering another room, Jonouchi spots a card on the ground, running over to pick it up. He discovers that the card is trap card, and seconds later the floor opens up into a slide underneath him. His friends both dive after him, but Honda shoves Yugi aside, telling him to go on ahead and assuring him that they\u0026rsquo;ll catch up. Yugi yells as Honda also vanishes through the gap in the floor, which closes behind. Below the ground, Honda finds Jonouchi starting a duel against a man that introduces himself as Pete Coppermine, the card professor of that block, who admits that he didn\u0026rsquo;t expect anyone to come tumbling down there. As the duel starts, another man appears from a second door. He presents itself as Kirk Dixon and says that he didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to miss the fun as his block was even further separated from the main route so he thought that no-one would ever get to that point. He challenges Honda to a duel, and he hesitantly accepts, thinking on buying at least some time until Jonouchi can defeat his opponent and deal with this guy. The two card professor mock them at first, treating as they are just a couple of losers that would only serve as momentary entertainment. But Pete is quickly outmatched by Jonouchi and promptly defeated. Kirk is surprised by that and makes some mistakes that Honda takes advantage of, managing to pull an unexpected win. Jonouchi and Honda pick up the security keys from the defeated professors and leave, looking to find a way to reunite with Yugi. As they pass through the weird Solid Vision labs, Jonouchi congratulates Honda on his very first win. Meanwhile, Yugi gets to the next block and finds a restaurant. He can\u0026rsquo;t advance any further so he looks around and see an old lady in a wheelchair drinking tea. He walks to her and asks her if she saw anyone wearing a duel disk around. To his surprise, she activates a mechanism in her wheelchair and a modified duel disk appears. She is the next card professor he must face: Maico Kato. The two of them have a good and honest duel that shows that she has the skills to be a card professor, but ends up being defeated by Yugi in the end. As she gives him the security key, she says she is glad to have dueled him, and that her grandchildren\u0026rsquo;s will love this story. As Yugi takes the key, he is surprised to see Yako Tenma sitting near them, watching the duel. Episode 94 - The Showdown, and then\u0026hellip;?!\rSeeing Yako Tenma sitting on the floor above, Yugi thinks that he is no hologram this time as he can sense his duelist\u0026rsquo;s aura. Yugi reaches Yako\u0026rsquo;s floor and asks why is he here, as this isn\u0026rsquo;t the top of the building. Yako, who is accompanied by Mr. Croquet, agrees (they\u0026rsquo;re only halfway up), and remarks that he\u0026rsquo;s been watching Yugi. He praises him for being a brilliant duelists and says that there are only six Card Professors left. Yugi thinks in satisfaction that Jonouchi is also winning his way up the building. Yako says that he wants to test a new strategy, reasuring Yugi that the duel will have no effect on his progress up the building and telling him that he will let him see Anzu if he wins. But if Yugi loses, he will have to give out his Egyptian Gods. They duel, with Yugi taking the upper hand but quickly being surpassed by Yako, who is able to set everything in place to summon his Wicked God. To Yugi\u0026rsquo;s surprise, instead of summoning \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; Yako summons \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Dreadroot\u0026rdquo;, the second Wicked God. Meanwhile, in another area of the building Jonouchi and Honda hear a noise that they think is one of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s God cards. Honda is shocked that Yugi\u0026rsquo;s opponent is of the strength that would force Yugi to Summon one of the God cards, and they decide to hurry up and get up there. Yako Tenma, wearing his normal attire, laughs as he stands in front of Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body, trapped in a machine and glowing with light. He comments on the energy, stating that the Project has just advanced to the next stage. Back in the theater where Yugi is dueling, \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Dreadroot\u0026rdquo; emerges from a blaze of power behind Yako. Yugi struggles to defend himself. At the sideline, Croquet claps his hands, thinking that this is perfect. Yugi may have conquered Duelist Kingdom and Battle City, and is truly an elite Duelist, but of all the Duelists raised by Pegasus, Master Tenma was the only one he called \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo;. He thinks that the outcome of the Duel is clear. Yugi is pushed to his limits but he refuses to lose, he has to beat him and save Anzu. He pulls off a great fusion combo and manages to slash through the Wicked God. A second Tenma (like a projection) emerges from his body, thinking that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe it: to think a non-God could defeat a \u0026ldquo;Wicked God\u0026rdquo;. No matter though; he\u0026rsquo;s already achived his objective. His image fades away, as he thinks to himself \u0026ldquo;see you later, big brother.\u0026rdquo; Episode 95 - The Tenma Brothers\u0026rsquo; Secret\u0026hellip;!\rTenma falls to his knees and Croquet rushes up to him, telling Yugi that he is no longer in any condition to fight. Suddenly, Yako Tenma appears on a videoscreen, congratulating Yugi for his victory. Yugi asks if this is a recording but Yako replies that it\u0026rsquo;s live. He has been on the top floor of the building the entire time, and the person defeated by Yugi was someone he was mind-controlling: his twin brother Gekko Tenma. Gekko begs Yako to stop all of this, but Yako thanks him on advancing the R.A. Project to the next phase. He shows Yugi Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body connected to a machine, and he is horrified to see that Anzu\u0026rsquo;s eyes are blank. Yako caresses her head, telling Yugi that this is the former Anzu Mazaki; thanks to the energy emitted by \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Dreadroot\u0026rdquo;, her body and soul have been separated. She\u0026rsquo;s now a vessel for the next soul: Pegasus\u0026rsquo; soul. His right eye bulges as he explains that the purpose of the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026quot;ebirth of \u0026ldquo;A\u0026quot;vatar Project is to summon Pegasus to him once again. Soon, he will begin the procedure to transfer Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s soul into Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body. He wonders if Yugi can stop him, and cuts the feed with a laugh. Gekko rips apart the Wicked Dreadroot card and explains to Yugi that Yako is using the power of the Wicked Gods to achieve his objectives. He controlled his mind because he opposed to his plan, and the next stage of that plan was unlocked moments. The amount of duel energy released was enough to separate Anzu\u0026rsquo;s soul from her body. Gekko apologizes, and reminds Yugi that he said he\u0026rsquo;d let him see her if he won, and explains that her spirit is as of now trapped in the Duel Ring Server, so if he puts her card in his Duel Disk, she\u0026rsquo;ll appear. Yugi places Anzu\u0026rsquo;s Soul Prison card in his duel disk and Anzu appears in front of him as a hologram, gasping in surprise. She dives forward, her image passing right through him. She is sad, but tries to put a brave face as Yugi assures her he will rescue her. Then, Gekko continues to explain what is going on. Yako and Gekko were orphans, adopted by Pegasus, who trained brilliant kids from all over the world as game designers and duelists. But everything changed after the Duelist Kingdom tournament. Pegasus was injured after his duel with Yugi, he lost his golden eye and ended up in a coma. In a flashback, it\u0026rsquo;s shown that the two brothers were at the side of Pegasus bed, when one night Shadi materialized from thin air. They recognized him from a painting, and while Shadi barely looked at them, he gave the unconscious Pegasus a long look before turning around to leave. Yako jumped in front of him and asked if there was a way to save Pegasus, but Shadi replied that he was lost, as he was attacked by someone who had taken his eye and put his mind in torment. Without his Millennium Eye, Pegasus\u0026rsquo; mind would wander in the shadows forever, in an eternal desert without escape. After that, Yako turned into research, looking at anything that might help him. He began researching the application of mystical energy present in the millennium items and the god cards, and ended up completing the work that Pegasus started by crafting the Wicked Gods: artificial god cards created from data Pegasus had left behind. These were cards of great power, relative to that of the Egyptian Gods and made to try to keep them in check if needed, but cursed as a result, filled with evil intent. And so, the evil within those cards poisoned Yako\u0026rsquo;s mind, damaging his psyche, and setting in motion his \u0026ldquo;Rebirth of Avatar Project\u0026rdquo;. With it, he aims to restore Pegasus mind into Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body as a vessel. Yugi and Anzu are shocked to hear this, and they ask why they are using her for this, why are they all involved in this. Gekko answers that according to Yako it was due to three specific conditions. They needed to use Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s central computer to properly control the required amount of duel energy, so they took the opportunity now that Kaiba was currently in America after Battle City. Second was that they needed a host to be mentally and physically healthy to withstand the duel energy, as they couldn\u0026rsquo;t move or use Pegasus real body. The third condition was that the host needed to be someone whose possession would inflict a great pain to Yugi Muto, who was in Yako\u0026rsquo;s eyes responsible of what happened to Pegasus. Anzu protest that Yugi wasn\u0026rsquo;t the one that put Pegasus in that state, but Gekko replies that someone told Yako that he did. That someone was Bandit Keith, a revelation that shocks Yugi and Anzu. In his mind, Yugi and his other self briefly talk about this. They know that the real attacker was the evil persona of Bakura hidden in the Millennium Ring, something Ishizu told them back during the events of Battle City. Gekko then tells how Yako first tested this project in Keith himself. They found him lost and confused, his mind completely gone after being mind-controlled by someone else. Yako had detected that it was a power similar to the one that put Pegasus in a coma, although not as severe, so he took the opportunity to test his theory. By using the power of the Wicked Gods and a modified duel disk, Yako had constantly dueled his card professors and barely managed to end up generating enough duel energy to restore Keith\u0026rsquo;s mind. Bandit Keith, who was originally the first ranked card professor, thanked Yako and told him that back in Duelist Kingdom he had seen Yugi leaving Pegasus\u0026rsquo; room with his Millennium Eye after the finals. Yugi and Anzu reply that that was a lie, as they argue that Bandit Keith was expelled from the castle before the finals, to which Gekko agrees. He did assume that it was most likely a lie, but when he confronted Yako about it it was too late, as Keith had already poisoned his brother\u0026rsquo;s mind with revenge. After confronting him, Gekko had fallen under his brother mind control since then and was only freed when Yugi destroyed the Wicked Dreadroot. At this point, a cackling laugh resonates in the place as the real Bandit Keith appears. Episode 96 - Jonouchi\u0026hellip; Helpless?\rAs Honda and Jonouchi climb some stairs they stumble upon a girl with a Duel Disk grabbing a soda from a vending machine. Jonouchi shouts that he finally found the next card professor and challenges her to a duel, but she runs away. They run after her but she is really fast. They split up and Honda manages to find her first. He asks why is she running and she timidly replies that she is a little scared of duelists. He asks if she is really a duelist and she says that she is, in fact, a card professor in charge of that block: Reiko Kitamori. With his newfound confidence after beating the previous card professor, Honda challenges her to a duel. In the previous area, Yugi and Gekko were just interrupted by Keith, who arrived with another card professor called Ted Banias. He is the card professor of the next block, but was bored of waiting so Keith dragged him along to that place. Ted challenges Yugi, but Gekko stands in his way and duels him instead. After a back and forth duel, Gekko shows why he was called a \u0026ldquo;Perfect\u0026rdquo; duelist by Pegasus and wins the duel. Keith beats up Ted for losing. Yugi asks him for the security key but Keith says that he will lead them right to Yako himself. Jonouchi, who got lost, arrives moments later only to find out that Honda has been utterly defeated in just a couple of minutes. The girl is super shy though, and Jonouchi senses almost no fighting spirit in her. He assumes she must be a beginner, and that Honda lost because he is also a beginner. The duel then begins, and Jonouchi is surprised to see her reading her own cards after drawing them. Reiko confess that she only began playing duel monsters around a month ago. And yet, somehow, she gets the upper hand in their duel. Jonouchi is pushed against the ropes as her strategy proves to be really efective, but he senses that she is fighting scared so he talks and shows her a different approach to what actual dueling is all about, on how the duelists clash their souls against each other. By making a bold comeback, he manages to win the duel (while also letting out a sigh of relief). Reiko is no longer scared of the duelists, and is a bit excited after discovering a new side of herself during the duel. But when Honda asks her for the security key, she tells them that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any. She was there only to buy time, as the route they came down is a dead end. They are frustrated by this, as it seems they cannot get to the top of the building from that place. And just at that moment a computer screen nearby flashes up and Mokuba shows up, calling for them. Episode 97 - Pegasus\u0026rsquo; Prodigies!\rYugi and Gekko follow Keith through the building and get past the security blocks until they stumble upon two Card Professors. Gekko recognizes them as Pegasus proteges, and says that they were also trained by Pegasus like him. They are the top rank members of the Card Professor guild: Richie Merced (rank 1) and Scott Depres (rank 2). Richie confronts Keith for altering the plan and beats him up, stating that he is no longer relevant. Yugi stops him and Richie threatens to punch him too. Gekko intervenes, and he is called a traitor. He replies that this project is wrong but they pay no mind to his words, stating that bringing back master Pegasus is the most important thing for them. They then lead Yugi and Gekko towards the next area to duel, while Keith stays behind, apparently unable to move. Scott challenges Yugi to a duel. But in the place of his other self, Yugi decides to take up the challenge. He says to his other self that he has been dueling non-stop, he needs some rest and that he also want to help rescue Anzu. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to just stand around and watch. He takes out his own deck for the duel. As the battle unfolds, Scott proves to be incredible strong. At one point he calls out Yugi, having figured it out that it was his \u0026ldquo;weakest\u0026rdquo; self the one dueling, and demands to fight \u0026ldquo;the other yugi\u0026rdquo;. But the spirit in the puzzle shows up just for a moment to clarify that his partner is in no way weak, and that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need his help to destroy him. Back at it, Yugi performs a great combo to take back the initiative and win the duel. Richie steps up and challenges Gekko to a duel, showing his unique black duel disk, proof of being the first ranked Card Professor. He says that he cannot forgive Gekko for being a traitor, for betraying everyone raised by Pegasus. In turn, Gekko replies that he will take up the challenge and that while he also wants to see Pegasus again, they can\u0026rsquo;t drag Yugi or Anzu or Kaiba Corporation into this. The duel starts and they are evenly matched. Richie then says that there was a time when Pegasus called Gekko a \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; duelist, as the other kids weren\u0026rsquo;t able to beat him. But that was long ago, and while Gekko stood still he trained to become the number one Card Professor. Richie then outplays Gekko by taking advantage of his rush to save Anzu, and defeats him, much to Yugi\u0026rsquo;s horror. As Richie turns out to leave, Yugi yells at him to wait. Richie reminds Yugi of his promise: they had agreed to have Gekko fight for him. \u0026ldquo;This is as far as you go, Yugi\u0026rdquo; he says, as the door closes behind him. Gekko scream in frustration and a crying Yugi runs to the door, begging someone, anyone, to open it. They have to get to Yako, otherwise he won\u0026rsquo;t be able to save Anzu\u0026hellip; Episode 98 - Turning the Tides\rJonouchi and Honda each land a punch as the elevator doors open, knocking out one of the guards. They are advancing through the building by taking out the Industrial Illusion employees they find by force. Mokuba is guiding them using a communication device, as he is still in America with his brother. The Kaiba brothers learned about the breach a few hours ago, and they were trying to get everything under control once again. After understanding the situation, Mokuba had decided to guide Jonouchi and Honda to the server room so they could try to speed up the processs. Richie walks down the hallway and an Industrial Illusions employee congratulates him on his victory. He asks what the situation is like, and the man says that according to Yako the final phase is about to begin. There is a slight problem though, as Mokuba Kaiba is guiding the other two that came up with Yugi to the Duel Ring Server. Richie decides to deal with them himself, but he is stopped by Keith who had just overheard the conversation. Keith punches him as payback for before. Richie insults him, saying that he is nothing more than a guinea pig for Pegasus\u0026rsquo; summoning, and Keith replies that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about any of that. His only purpose here was to get revenge of those kids that made a fool out of him. Now that one is out of the picture, he\u0026rsquo;s got one target left: Jonouchi. And he is not giving him to Richie so he challenges him to a duel. As they battle, it becomes clear that Keith is holding up a trump card, and when Richie pushes him to the edge Keith brings forth the third Wicked God: \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Eraser\u0026rdquo;, to Richie\u0026rsquo;s surprise. \u0026ldquo;I hate to break it to you Richie, but i\u0026rsquo;m the number one Card Professor\u0026rdquo; he says as he launches his final strike. Meanwhile Jonouchi and Honda managed to get to the Duel Ring Server where they found a group of Kaiba Corporation employees. There, they follow instructions to let Mokuba access remotely. The place is really cold due to the external cooling needed to keep the servers operating, but the temperature is dangerously rising. If this keeps up, there\u0026rsquo;s no telling what could happen to the servers. Isono explains that the Industrial Illusions people input data for some new cards, and it\u0026rsquo;s been using all its processing power to perform strange calculations ever since. Jonouchi angrily asks \u0026ldquo;what about Yugi, where is he? Did he actually lose?\u0026rdquo;. He begs Mokuba to find Yugi, and Mokuba nods. Still where he was before, Yugi has failed to open that door, when he hears Anzu\u0026rsquo;s voice. He quickly puts her card onto his Duel Disk and she appears in the air. Yugi asks her what is wrong, and she replies that she\u0026rsquo;s scared, something is rushing into her. She begins to fade, asking Yugi if she\u0026rsquo;s going to disappear, and they reach out for one another as she fades fully. Yugi screams her name with tears in her eyes. Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s voice sounds out from the videoscreen at the wall, and Yugi answers. Tearing up, he tries to tell Jonouchi about Anzu, but Jonouchi tells him that this is no time for crying. Yako\u0026rsquo;s started his Project, so things aren\u0026rsquo;t looking so good. One employee suddenly tells Mokuba that all the data in the Duel Ring Server is being downloaded to one place: Anzu Mazaki, who is on the floor above them. Jonouchi contacts Yugi to tell him that he\u0026rsquo;s found Anzu, telling Yugi to leave her to them. He should just hurry and get up to the roof where Yako is. Mokuba opens the way for Yugi. Wiping his tears away, Yugi agrees, and turns to Gekko, who still kneels defeated on the walkway, telling him to come on. Gekko says that he lost so he mustn\u0026rsquo;t go any further, but Yugi convinces him to keep going to save his brother. Episode 99 - Rematch! Keith vs Jonouchi\rHonda and Jonouchi are in the ventilation ducts trying to get to where Anzu is, when they see Yugi and Gekko in a corridor. Jonouchi jumps out and attacks Gekko, thinking that is Yako. Yugi stops him and after a brief explanation Jonouchi calms down and apologizes. Honda leaps down from the ducts and sees Bandit Keith standing there looking at the group. Jonouchi deliberately ignores Keith and pushes Yugi and Gekko on, convincing them to keep going to find Yako. He then tells Honda to go save Anzu. Keith, furious that Jonouchi is ignoring him, challenges him. Jonouchi gives him a snarky comment and Keith warns that he came from the dead to destroy him. Just before leaving, Gekko explains what the black duel disk in Keith\u0026rsquo;s arm means and tells him to be careful. Honda also leaves, but tells him that Anzu is heavy and that he needs his help carrying her back there. Jonouchi mutters that he\u0026rsquo;ll tell her he said that, but Honda snaps at him to hurry up and come find them. Jonouchi gets serious and asks if Keith is Tenma\u0026rsquo;s pawn now, but he replies that this has nothing to do with it. He wanted revenge after Duelist Kingdom, but he got his mind twisted by that Marik guy. Yako healed him but Pegasus was in a coma so he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get his revenge against him. Instead he redirected Yako\u0026rsquo;s anger by telling him that Yugi was responsible for Pegasus fate, which he knew would lead him right to Jonouchi once again. Jonouchi asks if what he\u0026rsquo;s saying is that Keith wanted to Duel him, so he made Tenma target Yugi and Anzu. He clenches his fist, for that, Tenma nearly killed Anzu? Yeah, he\u0026rsquo;ll fight Keith, he yells furiously. He\u0026rsquo;ll kick him right back down to hell, and their rematch begins. The battle is intense. Keith is playing to his very best but Jonouchi is not losing ground. At one point Keith is both surprised and horrified to see that Jonouchi uses his own Time Machine card against him. It\u0026rsquo;s his card, and he\u0026rsquo;s been looking for it. Jonouchi points out that after he beat him at Duelist Kingdom, Keith got mad, threw his Deck down, and ran off, remember? He figured Keith didn\u0026rsquo;t care, so he helped himself to the card. Jonouchi admits that at Duelist Kingdom, he didn\u0026rsquo;t really have tactics, so he guesses he was an amateur then. But while Bandit Keith was wasting time being mind-controlled, he met all sorts of Duelists and he\u0026rsquo;s grown. Keith is now seeing the new and improved Jonouchi. He laughs, adding that Keith lost to him while he was an amateur, so there\u0026rsquo;s no way he can beat him now. Keith isn\u0026rsquo;t happy, but simply thinks that Jonouchi should go ahead and be overconfident. Keith takes a card from his wrist and attempts to place it in his duel disk, but suddenly an alarm begins ringing: the black duel disk prevents cheating. They continue exchanging blows until Keith manages to summon the third Wicked God to the field. Jonouchi is surprised that Tenma\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only Wicked God, and tries to defend himself as the god overpower his defenses. Eventually he find a way out and defeats The Wicked Eraser. But the dying god starts to take every card with him due to its effect, and it also seem that is affecting Jonouchi himself, who feels completely covered in darkness. He manages to shake it off and thinks that that was too close, Keith almost got him. Somehow it felt like he was getting swallowed up, sucked down into the darkness. And it felt like he was never going to be able to come back. Looking at Keith, he thinks that he is just like Tenma: they\u0026rsquo;re both possessed by the Wicked Gods. Keith asks Jonouchi why he won\u0026rsquo;t die. Why he resist. He tears his Wicked God card in half and drop the rest of his cards, clutching his head in pain. He starts asking if he is going to disappear again. If Jonouchi is going to hunt him all the way into the jaws of death. Jonouchi tells Keith that its his turn, and not to be afraid: he is going to save him now. He make a final move and wins the duel, dispelling the darkness. Removing his cards from the Black Duel Disk, Keith unclasps it and throws it to Jonouchi. He tells Jonouchi to fight him one more time and put on the Black Duel Disk. Jonouchi promptly refuses. Keith uses his fist in fury, but he\u0026rsquo;s too weak and his hand falls to the ground. Jonouchi explains that he\u0026rsquo;s not going to Duel Keith while he\u0026rsquo;s like this. Right now, he\u0026rsquo;s like some demon of vengeance. But even Keith must have been different when he first picked up a card, back when he Dueled just for the fun of it as he looks at Keith\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Barrel Dragon\u0026rdquo; card. He chuckles, admitting that he can\u0026rsquo;t imagine Keith ever being like that. Then he tells Keith that he\u0026rsquo;s giving this back to him, and places the \u0026ldquo;Time Machine\u0026rdquo; card in Keith\u0026rsquo;s hand, telling him to use that card, remember how it feels to Duel for fun and then come and find him. As he runs off, he tells Keith to face him as a Duelist instead of a demon, and he\u0026rsquo;ll Duel him anytime he wants. Episode 100 - Rebirth of Avatar!\rYako has gone to the very top of the building, the place called \u0026ldquo;Apex Arena\u0026rdquo;. In there he summons his Wicked Avatar and watches as it starts to accumulate more and more power. Now that they has gained enough duel energy, the process is in motion and it cannot be stopped. He calls for Pegasus and a shadowy figure of him actually appears, while at the same time a beam of pure energy hits Anzu. As Yugi and Gekko race down a corridor, a man leaning against a wall is shocked that they made it up to this floor, calling them losers. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard anything about losers getting a second chance, but he can\u0026rsquo;t just ignore them. Gekko grits his teeth, realizing that the man is a Card Professor called Willa Mette, but Yugi rushes forwards as the Millennium Puzzle glows. Yugi orders the Card Professor out of the way and defeats him in a one-turn kill combo using Osiris. Anzu wakes up in a dark place. For a brief moment she sees herself in the machine, but then her vision is obscured once again. She realizes that this is her own soul and that she is wandering in the most absolute darkness. There is nothing here. Scared, she calls out for her friends but there is no response. Suddenly, somewhere far away she hears a faint noise. She tries to focus on it and gets a glimpse of a small light that is slowly getting bigger and bigger. The light is approaching her, and transforms. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer a light, but a mist that takes human form. It takes the form of Pegasus but it has no mouth, and only one empty eye. She screams as the shadow extends his arms towards her. And then it vanishes. A sphere of darkness, even darker than everything around her, is formed where the mist was. And then, it passes through her. Memories and feelings invade her, rage and fury. But behind all of that a sensation of fear and pain. Of an artificial creation grasping for its own right to exist. A black sustance then start to cover Anzu from the feet up, and even though she tries to scream there is no one to hear, until she is completely swallowed and then\u0026hellip; there is only darkness. Episode 101 - Apex Arena\rHonda stands by Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body, still trapped in the machine. The door opens and Jonouchi runs in. Honda asks if he won and Jonouchi replies that of course he did. Noticing the black Duel Disk on Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s arm, he asks what it is, and Jonouchi explains that it means he\u0026rsquo;s the number one Card Professor. Anyway, they try to free Anzu but Mokuba shows up in a computer screen and warns them that they cannot take her out of there yet. She is still linked in to the Wicked God cards, and her spirit has become detached so unless they cut their link to the Wicked Gods, her spirit will never return to her body. Jonouchi is furious that Anzu is right there but they can\u0026rsquo;t save her. Mokuba explain that there\u0026rsquo;s just one way: they have to defeat the Wicked Gods. The three of them think of Yugi. At the Apex Arena, as the stream of lightning passes through \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; through the floor, Yako declares that the resurrection has begun, laughing. Yugi and Gekko arrive and he welcomes then. He asks if they see, if they hear. Each card contains a piece of its creator\u0026rsquo;s soul and now those pieces are shimmering with the power of the duels. Right now the Duel Ring Server is distilling that power and pouring it into Anzu Mazaki. Yugi yells at him to stop, but Yako holds up a card bearing the image of Pegasus and declares that he \u0026ldquo;summons Master Pegasus\u0026rdquo;, placing the card in his duel disk where it flares with electricity. Yugi has a brief vision of Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body covered in black shadows. The Wicked Avatar sends out a final wave of power, swirls\u0026hellip; and then begins to vanish. Yako cries his master\u0026rsquo;s name in vain, but the result is clear: The project has failed. Yako sinks to his knees and Yugi yells his name, asking what is the meaning of this. Gekko says that the R.A. Project has failed, and Yako stands up and looks at his brother with hate in his eyes. Gekko, the traitor, has no right to be there, he says. Gekko admits that he is right: he lost, he is powerless. He can\u0026rsquo;t fight anymore but Yugi can. Sneering, Yako says \u0026ldquo;how the Perfect Duelist has fallen\u0026rdquo;. A \u0026ldquo;Perfect Duelist\u0026rdquo;, Gekko muses. Yes, he admits, Master Pegasus called him that. It made him so proud, but over the course of many Duels, he realised something: Master Pegasus never meant that he was the Perfect Duelist. Yako is shocked, and Gekko explains that when they were with Pegasus, he did win his Duels with Yako and the other Pegasus prodigies, by a small margin. But every time they Dueled, their difference in skill diminished. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but realise his opponents were getting better. Gekko explains that he is \u0026ldquo;perfected,\u0026rdquo; and he will never grow. Yako is shocked, and Gekko continues, explaining that he thinks Pegasus must have seen with his Millennium Eye that Gekko\u0026rsquo;s Duelist level was as high as it would be. Yako angrily asks Gekko what he\u0026rsquo;s saying, grabbing him by the collar, and Gekko finishes that he thinks the one Pegasus saw potential in, the one he thought would become a first-rate Duelist, was Yako. Floored, Yako furiously yells at Gekko not to tell him that, not to dare say that to him. He shoves his brother back and says that the R.A. Project isn\u0026rsquo;t over. He still has the vessel, Anzu Mazaki, flooded with all the power of the Wicked Gods. He just needs to find Pegasus\u0026rsquo; soul. And to do that, he needs a final push of energy: Yugi\u0026rsquo;s god cards will be the final sacrifice. Yugi says that his fight with Pegasus was a battle between two Duelists. He tells Yako to release Anzu, as their fight has nothing to do with her. Yako replies that that\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible, as she has become part of the Wicked Gods and if they take her out of the Duel Ring Server she will die. He laughs, his right eye bulging, asking if Yugi likes the divine punishment of his gods. Gekko steps forward, telling Yugi to duel him. The only way to save Anzu is to smash his last god into pieces. Yako wonder what does he mean with \u0026ldquo;last\u0026rdquo; god, and shows that he has the three Wicked God cards with him, even though Gekko is sure that he ripped the Wicked Dreadroot in half. Yako explains that what Gekko used and then destroyed was a fake version of the card that was only working in the duels because they had modified the duel disks. The hidden benefit of having control of the Duel Ring Server was to let him cheat those cards by having Yako himself in the Apex Arena with the original cards in his modified duel disk while both Gekko and Keith used the fake versions in the tower. He never gave Gekko or Keith the original Wicked God cards after all. Episode 102 - Voice of the Avatar\rThe final duel between Yako and Yugi at the Apex Arena begins. They quickly swarm their own fields and fight back and forth. When Yako summons \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; he gains the upper hand and the Duel Ring Server starts performing strange calculation again much to Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s surprise. Meanwhile, the machine imprisoning Anzu\u0026rsquo;s flashes with a bright light. Jonouchi and Honda turn in shock as Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body arches, electricity flowing over it and her mouth open in a silent scream. At the Apex Arena, Yako has just successfuly summoned \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; and makes him take the form of Anzu Mazaki to torment Yugi. Yako comments that it looks like his precious friend is already being absorbed by the Wicked God. Then, the god take the form of another monster and the duel continues. Soon after, Yako plays a different strategy and makes The Wicked Avatar take the form of Yugi himself. Looking at the Wicked God, the other Yugi whispers \u0026ldquo;partner\u0026rdquo; in horror, realising that the Wicked God took his partner\u0026rsquo;s shape and is attacking him. Yako gets into his mind, saying that while he, \u0026ldquo;the other Yugi\u0026rdquo; was dueling in Duelist Kingdom and Battle City, his other self, the real Yugi, secretly hates him and this is the way it is going to get revenge. But then Yugi takes control of his body and puts Yako in his place, making it clear that he does not hate his other self, that he is his partner and that he has gained all sort of important things since meeting him. The duel continues and the gods clash against each other in a struggle of absolute power that shakes the ground beneath them, and causes a massive shockwave of energy to erupt from the top of the building and brighten the sky. The server can barely contain all the duel energy and Anzu\u0026rsquo;s body is once again shocked by electricity. Within the beam of light, Yako sees a vision of Pegasus walking away from him in the light. He begs and calls for him but there is no response, and then Pegasus fades away. Yugi, meanwhile, sees Anzu standing before him. She tells him that it\u0026rsquo;s okay, and smiles, reassuring him that she\u0026rsquo;ll be back before he knows it. As the light fades, Yugi smiles. Back in the machine, Anzu wakes up and Honda and Jonouchi celebrate. They take her out of the machine and help her get on her feet. The three of them go up to the Apex Arena to meet with the victorious Yugi now that the duel is over. Mokuba also confirms that the Duel Ring Server has returned to normal. As tears leak from Yako\u0026rsquo;s eyes, Yugi tells him that it\u0026rsquo;s time he let go. Yako replies that he\u0026rsquo;s gone, Master Pegasus is gone, it\u0026rsquo;s all over. He is about to surrender but Gekko stops him and tells him that he must keep dueling, for himself and not for the evil gods. Yako becomes resolute and he and Yugi clash one last time. After the dust is settled, Yako had regained his own duelist spirit, but Yugi raised even further and ends up winning the duel. Yugi tells Yako he was a mighty opponent, and he is surprised at the praise. Finally free of the influence of the gods, Yako throws the three cards to the wind just at Yugi\u0026rsquo;s friends arrive to the arena. At this point Anzu, still being carried by Jonouchi and Honda, tells them what happened to her while her soul was detached while in the machine: she says that she actually met with Pegasus soul. Everyone is surprised by this, and she narrate the conversation they had in the place full of darkness. Pegasus told her that his mind was originally trapped by the spirit of the Millennium Ring and he was cursed to wander the darkness forever. And he did, for what seemed to be years although there was no point of reference to use. But at some point, one time, he had felt a change. It was as if the power of that spirit had vanished. The darkness around him started to change and he found himself in an immense desert at night. He could see the sea of stars again above, but he was alone and there was infinite kilometers of sand in every direction. From that moment on he had wandered the sands in random directions, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until seeing a bright light that he had found what seemed to be the way home. That light was Anzu, and finding her allowed him to finally see a path to come back. She then concludes that Pegasus\u0026rsquo; soul should probably be okay after all. Yako and Gekko are shocked to hear this, and quickly get in touch with the people back in Industrial Illusion headquarters, who confirm that master Pegasus has opened his eyes and has returned to the world of the living. Apparently he can\u0026rsquo;t speak just yet, but is responding well as of now. Yako and Gekko start crying and Yugi smiles. He thinks that the moment the darkness vanished must have been the night of the duel between Bakura and the evil Marik, when the dark spirit of Bakura was beaten. His shadow magic must have weakened at that point, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until Pegasus met with Anzu that he found an anchor to come back to the real world. In the end, even if the Project R.A. had failed, Pegasus had returned after all. The following afternoon, Anzu, already recovered, returns to the street of the Kaiba Corporation building. Alone, she muses over the fact that she omitted telling Yugi and the rest something important that happened while her soul was in the dark place: She had met another being in there apart from Pegasus. The being was scared and tried to attack her, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t really hurt her in the form that she was in. As Anzu had approached it, she had felt that the being was in pain and suffering, its own existance being artificial, lacking purpose or direction, only filled with a mix of the most absolute fear and the desire to have the right to exist in the world. As Anzu walks down the street, she bends over some bushes and picks up a card, The Wicked Avatar card, muttering \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid, I found you\u0026rdquo;. Episode 103 - Invitation from Pegasus\rA few weeks have passed and Pegasus seems to be back in business as always. He is hosting a small tournament in Domino City and a lot of duelists and kids have gathered to play. At sunset, a visibly bruised Yugi arrives and meets him behind the duel arena. Pegasus asks what happened to him and Yugi laughs awkwardly, saying that he had an intense duel a little while ago. Pegasus comments that it must have been quite a battle if Yugi ended up like that, but Yugi brushes it aside and changes the topic. Pegasus apologizes for what transpired back in Duelist Kingdom and they end up in good terms. As they say their goodbyes, Pegasus happily comments that he has some big plans for the game going forward, and that he is flying to America that night to set up those things in motion. A couple of days later Yugi is in his house with his friends when he gets a card and a VHS tape from Pegasus addressed to him. This freaks out Jonouchi, who reminds them of what happened the last time they got a videotape from that guy. Yugi plays it: it\u0026rsquo;s a message from Pegasus asking him for help. He can\u0026rsquo;t specify what is going on through this recording, but he asks for him and his friends to come to America in a private plane to discuss this directly with him, with all expenses covered. The group is happy to go on a small vacation but Yugi is a bit worried as Pegasus looked to be hiding some distress. Outside his house, through a wire bug, Insector Haga and Dinosaur Ryuzaki hear that conversation and decide to follow them no matter what, convinced that Pegasus is going to give Yugi and his friends some super rare cards. The following day, Yugi, Honda, Jonouchi and Anzu board the private jet. Meanwhile, Haga and Ryuzaki manage to smuggle themselves onto the plane in a big bag to camouflage along the cargo. The trip is uneventful, and while his friends are having a good time, Yugi is worried. They arrive in San Francisco early in the morning, and some employees welcome them with instructions to get them first to Industrial Illusions main headquarters and later to their hotel. A familiar face is with those employees: Otogi, who has been working with Industrial Illusions designers and traveled here the previous week for his own project. He learned that they were arriving and decided to give them a bit of a surprise. As they drive through the city, they get to see some of the big tourist attractions. They finally arrive to Industrial Illusions but as they enter the building the gate closes behind them. They are then confronted by Kujaku Mai, who wears a strange duel disk. Right next to her is Pegasus, unconscious. Episode 104 - An Unexpected Enemy\rThe group ask what happened to Pegasus and why is she in there. Mai reveals in a flashback that the previous night Pegasus was in his office visibly in distress. She showed up and they had an intense duel. She defeated him, and took his soul into a card which he shows to Yugi and his friends. Brashly, she challenges Jonouchi to a duel and when he refuses, she activates a card called the Seal of Orichalcos that traps them both in a hexagram of green light that pushes his friends away. Neither of them can leave the duel area now. After this duel is over, she says, either Jonouchi or her would have lost their soul to that card. Jonouchi asks what happened, why is she doing that. In turn Mai reveals that after Battle City, she fell to loneliness and despair. What Marik did to her broke her mind, even though she tried to hide it. She lost all confidence, she lost all attachments and drifted away. But they found her, and gave her a new purpose and a new strength. Jonouchi asks who are \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; and two men introduce themselves as they are watching the duel from the second floor. They introduce as Valon and Rafael, and are spectators of the duel to see Mai\u0026rsquo;s progress. She then tells Jonouchi on how Valon found her at her lowest point, and how he guided her to Dartz who was the one that showed her the true path forward to become strong again and to leave all that pain behind. Mai pushes forward in the duel but Jonouchi is not fighting back because the card would take Mai soul if she loses. Meanwhile, the other Yugi tries to break the magic of the Seal of Orichalcos with his Millennium Puzzle but it does not work. Valon tells him to not waste his time. There is no denying that Mai is determined to fight Jonouchi with all her strength. It is at this point that he realizes Mai is not to be won back with timidity. He is still determined to help her, but his Dueling spirit will have to keep back her rage. Meanwhile, Haga and Ryuzaki have gotten out of their cargo bag and are watching the duel from outside, wondering what is happening. Backed into a corner by Mai\u0026rsquo;s powerful new strategies and anger, Jonouchi notices a bright light coming from his deck. As he draws, he gets a vision of a strange world and a crystalline statue of a dragon with a sword stuck in it. He is floating in the air, but there is no one else around. Without knowing what to do, he removes the sword, freeing the dragon and bonding with it. In the real world, the card he just drew is revealed to be the figure of that very same dragon, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;The Claw of Hermos\u0026rdquo; and opens up new possibilities for his deck. Rafael and Valon have orichalchos fragments with them that start to shine in response to that card, making them both nervous as they realize that it must be one of the \u0026ldquo;Legendary Dragons\u0026rdquo;. With that card, Jonouchi takes the advantage once again and Mai starts to behave erratically. Rafael mutters that she is losing her composure. Valon jumps out of the balcony and uses the orichalchos stone in his ring to break through the barrier projected by the Seal, interrupting the duel. The magical barrier explodes, and when the smoke clears, both duelists are inconscious. Valon clutches Mai to him and pays no heed to Rafael\u0026rsquo;s scolding. Rafael tells Yugi he\u0026rsquo;ll be going after him next. He raises his own stone, projecting a light which makes everybody shield their eyes. When they look again, the three are gone. Episode 105 - The Shadow of Dartz\rFar from San Francisco, in Duelist Kingdom actually, Kaiba lands with his Blue-Eyes White Dragon Jet and meets up with Yako and Gekko. Kaiba scolds them for what they did a little while ago when they stormed his building, but he says that he is not in there for them but rather to talk with Pegasus. They reply that Pegasus is not there, which makes Kaiba angry. They tell him about some recent events that happened in the island a few days ago. A hooded man, who went by the name Dartz, showed up and beat them both together in a duel. He had amazing skill. Afterwards, he used the Industrial Illusion facilities in the island to create some cards with the help of his goons. Pegasus was in their headquarters in America when it happened, and he stayed there investigating the issue ever since. Kaiba says that he received a message from Pegasus himself inviting him to the island to talk about certain things regarding the upcoming KaibaLand, that\u0026rsquo;s why he is there. Yako and Gekko are confused by this, but then the door behind them opens and Pegasus himself appears, smiling and inviting Kaiba to a duel. They go inside the castle and get to the main duel arena. Kaiba questions what were the issues that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t discuss by phone that forced him to go in there in person, as he is really testing his patience now. They are business partners, even after everything that happened, only due to Duel Monsters popularity, but he won\u0026rsquo;t tolerate stupidity or being ordered around. Pegasus plays the innocent and says that everything will be revealed after the duel. The battle begins and Pegasus favors his Toon Monsters, which his opponent despises. Kaiba hasn\u0026rsquo;t been dueling for a while as he chose to focus on KaibaLand after Battle City, so he wants to end this quickly. He uses his powerful dragons to take the advantage and destroys his toon combo. At this point, Kaiba asks who is he and why is he impersonating Pegasus. Yako and Gekko are confused at what he means. Kaiba says that the Pegasus he knew wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been bested so easily. At this point \u0026ldquo;Pegasus\u0026rdquo; smiles and his face flickers revealing it was a hologram. Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s opponent is in fact, a man named Amelda who was disguised as Pegasus. He then activates The Seal of Orichalcos. Gekko and Yako recognize that card as the one that the man named Dartz created in there. The power of the Seal pushes them both away, and Amelda says that whoever loses the Duel will lose his \u0026ldquo;soul\u0026rdquo;. Kaiba demands an explanation. Amelda holds out a charred action figure from his pocked, and tell him that it belonged to his brother. He grew up in a war zone with his little brother Miruko as his only family. When the fighting grew worse, the two of them had to surface from shelter and move elsewhere. For a moment, their side gained an advantage, bringing out a fleet of recently-purchased Kaiba Corporation tanks. But when Amelda helped Miruko into a tank so as to escape, he had to go back to pick up Miruko\u0026rsquo;s dropped locket of their mom. The tank was bombed, and Amelda was faced by a fleet of enemy choppers, knowing by the flames of the tank near him that his brother was dead. Picking up the burnt toy that was all he had left of his brother, he looked and saw a man in a red suit shaking hands with the enemy troops. Later, he met Dartz with his mantle on, who explained to him that the man in the red suit was Gozaburo, the president of Kaiba Corporation, and the true killer of his brother. A terrible man who sold weapons to both sides of the conflict for field testing. Amelda vowed to take revenge on Kaiba Corporation, and now that the old man was gone, he was focused on Seto and Mokuba as the heirs of that corporation. Even if they made changes to turn it to a gaming company, their whole empire was built with dirty money so he would not stop until see it collapse. Seto remains silent and the duel continues. Amelda tactics prove to be strong and Kaiba is pushed back. Just as his options seem to dwindle to nothing, his deck responds with a bright glow which transports him to a vision of another world. He arrives before a crystal statue of a dragon with a sword thrust in it. He removes the sword, unlocking \u0026ldquo;Fang of Critias\u0026rdquo; from its prison and bonding to it. With his new card, he takes the advantage and is about to win but Amelda activates a card which forces the duel to end in a draw. A beam of green light shoots up from the depths of the Seal of Orichalcos, knocking Seto back. When he looks up again, Amelda is out of sight, but fires a parting shot that he will have his revenge. Episode 106 - The Seal of Orichalcos\rMeanwhile in Industrial Illusions headquarters, the real Pegasus is unresponsive so his employees take him to a medical center. Haga and Ryuzaki saw the duel and were fascinated by the power Mai was displaying. Since they were outside, they saw Rafael and Valon exit from a side door riding motorcycles and decided to follow them. Yugi and the group go to Pegasus office to look for any clues. In there, Yugi unlocks the door with that card that he got with the VHS tape and finds a Toon-decorated room with a recording from Pegasus: He tells them about Doma, a financial organization with a ton of capital and influence that has been interested in Duel Monsters as of recently and managed to infiltrate Duelist Kingdom to print their own cards, a series of powerful spell cards called \u0026ldquo;The Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo;. He tells them that their leader, Dartz, is dangerous and very skilled as he defeated Yako and Gekko together. Finally, Pegasus tell them that he made a card to help Yugi fight this new threat, and has it hidden in the room. They search for it and find it within a Pot of Greed replica, although it is empty and has no text. That night, they are at the hotel and there is a mix of sorrow and tension in the air. Jonouchi is worried about Mai and doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand how could this have happened. Anzu tries to comfort him while Otogi and Honda went to buy something to drink for all of them. Yugi, in the meantime, has just finished taking a shower when a hooded figure breaks into his room and takes the Egyptian God Cards that were laying in the table. They all rush behind that man and stop them in the roof of the hotel. He stands near the ledge and introduces himself as Gurimo, one of the members of Doma. Then he challenges Yugi to a duel by using the Seal of Orichalcos. As they battle, Gurimo explains the full power of the seal. On how it is an ancient relic from the fabled Atlantis, and has now been turned into a card in modern times. The power of the seal is too strong and Yugi finds himself in a terrible position. At that moment, his deck shines and just like Jonouchi and Kaiba, Yugi has a vision of another world. He and the other Yugi are floating above a high castle. They see Kuriboh looking at them and guiding them inside. Upon entering, they see a giant dragon sealed in ice, having a sword stabbed in his eye. Suddenly, Dark Magician Girl appears and starts talking to them. She tells them that this is the Duel Monsters Spirit World, and as of recent there is a \u0026ldquo;Dark Sun\u0026rdquo; in the sky which is assimilating Duel Monsters and growing, slowly covering the whole sky. They saw it briefly just moments before, a gigantic yellow eye surrounded in darkness and covering a huge portion of the firmament. Dark Magician Girl begs upon both Yugis to save their world, and tells them to unseal the final Nameless Dragon. They approach the crystal and pull the sword, freeing the dragon and somehow learning its name: Timaeus. Yugi then has another vision of himself, Jonouchi and Kaiba using the three cards, with dragons coming out of the cards. Awakening from his vision, Yugi finds in his hand the card \u0026ldquo;Eye of Timaeus\u0026rdquo; and uses it to win the duel. Rafael, Valon and Mai, who were watching the battle from the rooftop of the neighboring building, make their escape taking the Egyptian God cards with them. Episode 107 - The Darkness Within\rThe following morning, Yugi and his friends now unsure on what to do, decide to go see professor Arthur Hopkins who lives nearby. After hearing what Gurimo said about Orichalcos belonging to Atlantean mythology, Yugi thought about asking the professor as he was not only an expert in ancient history, but was the one who discovered the alleged ruins of Atlantis a year ago. They get in contact with him and he lets them know how to get to where he lives, in a rural area. Otogi drives them there while Anzu is the navigator. It takes them almost the entire day but they get there before dark and find not only the professor but also Rebecca. She has grown since their last encounter, and is super friendly with Yugi, even calling him her boyfriend, something that bothers Anzu quite a bit. They talk with Arthur and he explains what he knows: that the ruins he found trace Atlantis to be a civilization dated to roughly 2600 years ago, and not 9000 like some historic texts said. Apparently they did had a special mineral called Orichalcos (or orichalcum) and were pretty advanced for their own age. The civilization was wiped from the face of the earth by an unknown phenomenon, most likely a series of volcano eruptions. Arthur tells them that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Doma or Dartz, but he shows them something interesting. In the ruins that he personally found, there were large murals not that different to the ones found in ancient Egypt. Murals depicting giant monsters that bear a resemblance to duel monsters. Yugi and the rest are surprised by this, and the other Yugi says to his other self that this is most likely connected to how ancient civilizations dealt with the monsters back in the day. Now that Pegasus has recreated those games in a card form, it makes sense that they can uncover more information from these types of findings. Later that night, Yugi calls Kaiba Corporation and after some time he manages to get in contact with Kaiba himself, who has returned to America. Kaiba asks what does Yugi want, and he says that they need to meet in San Francisco. He briefly explain what is he doing there and everything that happened. Kaiba is about to hang up when Yugi asks if he also got a new dragon card with a strange effects appear out of nowhere in his deck. Kaiba says nothing and ends up hanging the phone, thinking about what he just heard. What catches his attention is that he has heard the name Doma, as a hermetic organization with a lot of influence. If they are messing with duel monsters and have attacked Industrial Illusions, it\u0026rsquo;s probable that they will come after his own company next. He calls Mokuba and tells him to find where Yugi is. The guys rest, but in the middle of the night Rebecca wakes Yugi and silently asks for his help, with tears in her eyes. Moments ago some hooded men got in the house and captured the professor, taking him hostage. She shows him a message recorded in a Duel Monsters Card and signed by Rafael: he demands Yugi to come alone to the Death Valley. He must not wake or bring anyone else, otherwise the professor would die. Yugi decides to comply and tells Rebecca to keep it a secret. He takes her horse and rides to the location drawn on the card. In there, he finds Rafael but there is no sign of the professor. Rafael says that he already freed him and was just waiting for Yugi to arrive. Yugi demands to know why are they \u0026ldquo;carding\u0026rdquo; people, but he says that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know. Denying Yugi\u0026rsquo;s accusation of being \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo;, Rafael questions what he understands for \u0026ldquo;justice\u0026rdquo; instead. He claims that history will decide if the road taken by Doma is evil or not. They duel, and Yugi finds out pretty quickly how skilled Rafael actually is, and what great connection he has with his cards. Rafael tells him his backstory, of when he was shipwrecked on an island for years as a child after losing his family. His sole companions back then were the characters in a comic book that he had with him. When he was finally rescued from the island, he found the normal world depressing. That was when he was approached by Dartz and joined Doma, hoping to find the answer to \u0026ldquo;fate\u0026rdquo; itself. The only joy he found was when he discovered that the Duel Monsters game had turned the characters in that comic into real cards. Ever since then he had treated those cards with the utmost respect, and even pays any cost to prevent them to be sent to the graveyard, as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose anyone else. Meanwhile, Jonouchi has woken up and discovered what happened. They are all awake now and Anzu tells him not to be harsh on Rebecca, as she was only trying to help her grandfather. Jonouchi leaves the house only to find Arthur walking towards them, visibly bruised. Anzu and Rebecca take care of him while Otogi, Honda and Jonouchi drive to where Yugi went. As they duel, Rafael words begin to sting in the most vulnerable side of the other Yugi. As the nameless pharaoh that he is, was he a fair king back then? Or was he a tyrant who oppressed people? What is the reason of his return to this era? Why is he so linked to the Millennium Items, objects that have proven to be extremely evil? The other Yugi is unable to answer any of that and thinks back to the vision he had with Kaiba in the duel tower. At one point, through the effect of \u0026ldquo;Exchange\u0026rdquo; Rafael gives the card \u0026ldquo;Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo; to Yugi. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have to use it, but he feels that he needs to, ignoring the protests of his partner. When he activates it, the Timaeus card abandons him and although he gains the upper hand momentarily, Rafael actually outplays him and takes the win. The pharaoh drops to his knees, in horror of what just happened, on how he fell to his own dark thoughts. But before the seal can take his soul, Yugi appears out of the Millennium Puzzle and pushes his other self out of the way at the last second. The seal then takes Yugi\u0026rsquo;s soul and not the one from the Pharaoh. Rafael, unaware of what actually happened, departs the area in a chopper with his men. Jonouchi and the rest, who managed to see the final turns of the duel, approach their defeated friend. The Pharaoh cries in regret and frustration upon the loss of Yugi. Episode 108 - On the Wrong Track\rThe conclusion of the last duel has a heavy price: the other Yugi is crushed as his actions and recklessness have resulted in the loss of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s soul. Rebecca cries in sorrow and blames it on him. They get in contact with Kaiba trying to get some help but after hearing that Yugi lost, Kaiba insults him and hangs up. Without much of a plan, they decide to return to the city and search for Doma headquarters directly. Jonouchi, Honda, Anzu and Yugi will get there in train while Otogi stays for a bit with Rebecca and Arthur as the professor makes some more research on the topic through all of his books, and then follow them shortly in the car. Meanwhile, within Doma\u0026rsquo;s headquarters, in an underground secret temple, Rafael report his success on taking down their biggest threat. However Dartz corrects him as the soul he took was the one of Yugi instead of the Pharaoh, explaining to him about his dual persona. The walls around them are filled with small stone slabs, each containing a human figure. These are souls, and among them are Yugi\u0026rsquo;s and Pegasus\u0026rsquo; souls. The group gets to the train, with the other Yugi still being depressed. At one point he excuses himself and goes into the inter-carriage space, hitting a wall in frustration. The train makes a stop in a station and Jonouchi gets off the train for a moment to buy some snacks with Honda. When they are about to get back on, Ryuzaki stops them and forces Jonouchi to a duel using the Seal of Orichalcos, making them lose the train. Back at the train, Anzu is a bit worried that neither Honda nor Jonouchi have returned, and Yugi has been gone for a while so she goes to search after him. Yugi, meanwhile, has encountered Haga who is wearing the same duel disk that Rafael and Mai did, and says that he\u0026rsquo;ll wait for him on top of the train. Yugi climbs up and Anzu, who sees him from the other end of the wagon, climbs after him. On top of the train, Haga uses his Seal of Orichalcos card and duels Yugi. In a flashback it is shown that Haga and Ryuzaki, after seeing the Mai vs Jonouchi duel, followed the antagonists to their headquarters and asked their help to become strong, pledging their allegiance to their cause. Dartz showed them a room filled with strong cards. He improved their decks and gave them the orichalcos cards. Afterwards he assigned them on the task of defeating the Pharaoh and Jonouchi. As they departed, Dartz smiled and Rafael said that he\u0026rsquo;d prefer if those two manage to win but if they lose their souls could still be offered to their god. During the duel, Jonouchi shows that he has learned quite a lot and manages to beat Ryuzaki, even after he has upgraded his deck. Ryuzaki himself confess that at first he didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to do all of this, but ended up being convinced by Haga, as he felt for a while that he has been on a losing streak and that his last moment to shine was back when he got second place in the national championship, and all of that seems too distant now. On the other hand, Haga toys with the other Yugi and makes him really angry by destroying a fake card after saying that it was Yugi\u0026rsquo;s soul. The Legendary Dragon card is not working for the Pharaoh, as if refusing to help him after he fell to his dark thoughts in the previous duel. In the end, out of pure willpower, the other Yugi manages to comeback and defeat Haga with a brutal combo that has Anzu begging for him to stop. The other Yugi shakes Haga and demands that he reveal how to find Yugi and free his soul. Alas, it is too late, as the \u0026ldquo;The Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo; has already done its job. Both Haga and Ryuzaki lose their souls, leaving the gang without any leads just as before. Episode 109 - The Avenging Amelda - Duel in the Sky\rDartz receive the souls of Haga and Ryuzaki and offers them to his god. He says that they are close now to finishing the ritual. The three Egyptian God cards are also there, alongside all the souls in the walls that his men have captured. Mai and Valon arrive in motorcycles to the house of professor Hopkins. She demands to see Jonouchi, but after Otogi says that he and the rest are gone, she storms off before Valon can stop her. Rebecca challenges Valon as payback for Yugi, and Otogi joins her in a two-versus-one duel, but he proves to be really strong and defeats them both before going again after Mai. He didn\u0026rsquo;t use the seal of orichalcos card against them, so Otogi\u0026rsquo;s and Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s souls are safe for now. Anzu and Yugi reunite with Honda and Tristan in the city station, after they boarded a second train some time later. In the meantime they were trying to find out how to get to Doma headquarters, but don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to get there and neither could they because they have the unconscious bodies of Haga and Ryuzaki. Meanwhile Kaiba and Mokuba are traveling to San Francisco too in a Kaiba Corporation plane, when Amelda\u0026rsquo;s voice booms out through the speakers. He lures them to the cabin, where the auto-pilot is on, and the pilots are unconscious. He then challenges Kaiba to a duel and he accepts. As they battle, Amelda uses the Seal of Orichalcos which makes part of the plane\u0026rsquo;s ceiling disappear, showing the sky directly. During the fight, Amelda pours every single bit of hate that he has towards Kaiba Corporation, but Kaiba endures it stoically. Since the moment he took over Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s position he has changed his company from its old days. Transforming a military company into a gaming one, focused on bringing up smiles and not suffering. But he cannot deny the past and he will endure the hate and suffering that Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s choices have caused. Mokuba then shows up, talking about what his brother has done to turn the company in a new direction, on how he was the one who did the most to undo the evil of the past, but Amelda doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear it and drives Kaiba to the edge. As he hears Amelda\u0026rsquo;s talk about his lost brother, Kaiba claims that if he had been in his place, he\u0026rsquo;d definitely have done the impossible to save his own brother. But he also says to Mokuba to stop defending him, because when he took over Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s company he also took over his sins. In the end, Kaiba manages to turn the duel around and defeat Amelda. Surprinsingly, it is Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s encouragement, empaty and support of his older brother that makes Amelda regain his own humanity once again, stopping his blind rage for a second to understand how similar both he and Seto are, and that he has been trying to undo the faults of his adoptive father. As the seal of orichalcos claims his soul, he smiles after a final look at Mokuba, seeing instead the brother that he protected so long ago. As his eyes closes, he lets go of his rage and his soul is taken by the seal. Kaiba manages to take control of the plane once again and they arrive at San Francisco that afternoon. There, Kaiba buys a car and gets in contact with Yugi and the rest. He tells them the location of Doma\u0026rsquo;s headquarters and that he is going there to settle this. If they want to do something about it, this is the time. Episode 110 - Clash! Jonouchi vs. Valon\rOtogi, Rebecca and Arthur reunite with the group and tell them about what happened with Valon and Mai, which pisses Jonouchi off. They all get to the building where Doma supposedly operates, and Kaiba and Mokuba arrive in the new car shortly after, with Kaiba briefly confronting Yugi about losing a duel. The professor then reveals what he has found: that Doma is most likely connected to Atlantean mythology, and that there is a possibility that they are gathering souls for an ancient ritual of summoning a powerful wicked creature to the world, just as old stories said. Yugi assumes that it must be the evil creature he saw back in the Duel Monsters Spirit world, and if that thing gets turned into a card it could be incredibly powerful. The building is closed and they cannot get in. A bunch of police officers that were nearby come up to them, wearing the mark of the seal of orichalcos in their foreheads. They start summoning monsters and attacking them, so the group splits up. Rebecca leads Kaiba, Mokuba and Yugi to the building by hacking the servers and finding an alternative entrance, while the rest stay to fend off the officers. Jonouchi sees Valon in the distance and runs after him, while Anzu, Otogi and Honda duel against the threat. Jonouchi yells out to Valon but he rides away on his motorcycle. Jonouchi picks up a motorcycle from one of those police officers and chases after him. Valon stops in a vacant lot nearby. Jonouchi tries to confront him about Mai, but Valon questions his right to ask, as she isn\u0026rsquo;t on Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s side anymore. Even when Jonouchi says he\u0026rsquo;ll get her back, Valon claims Jonouchi doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the pain Mai\u0026rsquo;s gone through. He claims that as long as Jonouchi is around, Mai won\u0026rsquo;t stop suffering and to prevent that he\u0026rsquo;ll take it on himself to defeat Jonouchi. And thus, a duel begins. The fight is intense, as Valon uses his powerful armor cards to take part of the battle himself. Valon says that his deck has nothing but attack cards, as opposed to any unnecessary things. He reflects on the fact that he\u0026rsquo;s been that way \u0026ldquo;ever since I was a brat\u0026rdquo;. When he was younger, he lived in a church, though he often got into fights (even against groups much bigger than him). Despite his rough streak, a kind nun looked after him and helped keep him grounded. One day, when a gang of thugs showed up to drive the nun out because their boss had bought the church, she tried to protect the children living there. They ignored her pleas and shoved her aside. Valon immediately moved to defend her, but she stopped him before he could fight. That night, he came running to the church, only to find it engulfed in flames. Behind him, he heard the cruel laughter of the thugs, mocking that the fire saved them the trouble of tearing the place down themselves. Minutes later, Valon staggered into a dark alley, breathless and gripping a pipe that slipped from his hands as he stood over the thugs’ beaten bodies. He was arrested, and even in prison, he got into massive fights with other prisoners and guards. The warden called him from solitary confinement to offer a way to get out of his sentence. If he won a series of Duels, he would be free. Without a word, Valon accepted, and he was taken to an island, where he unflinchingly used the Seal of Orichalcos on other prisoners. When the guards returned for him, he had defeated everybody, and Dartz revealed himself to be the one who had set up the deal. He accepted Dartz\u0026rsquo;s offer of employment in Doma and the chance to fight stronger opponents, although he warned Dartz that he might end up beating him. Back in the present, he explained to Jonouchi that what had been most important in his life had been gone for a while. He, Rafael, and Amelda were different from Jonouchi. They didn’t have to shoulder burdens. He was able to fight for his own goal, which was victory. Jonouchi considered these words, which he might have agreed with in the past, back when he had enjoyed fighting. But after all he had been through, he knew there was more to what he did than just winning, and he said so. He affirmed that he wouldn’t lose to someone like Valon, and Valon invited him to go ahead and try if he really thought he could beat him. As their fierce duel drew to a close, Mai arrived just in time to witness the ending. Both duelists were battered and bruised from cards that forced them into physical combat, leaving them gasping for breath. Despite the pain, Valon’s eyes lit up with excitement: he had never faced anyone like this before. With a grin, he declared how glad he was to be in such a duel, and Jonouchi, equally worn down but smiling, agreed. Mai tells Valon off for challenging her rival and demands to switch with him, but he refuses, saying that he finally understands why she\u0026rsquo;s so drawn to fight Jonouchi. He has something the two of them don\u0026rsquo;t have; a simple and direct passion, one that goes beyond Dueling. With that, he and Jonouchi go back to their Duel. As they clash one final time, with one last yell, Jonouchi sends Valon flying back. His life points drop to zero and he admits his defeat, dropping to one knee. As the seal of orichalcos encircles him, he turns to Mai who is very shaken by the outcome and tells her not to look like that. Even though she saw the awful side of him and he still lost, he has no regrets. She moves closer to him, stepping within inches of the border. Valon then turns to Jonouchi and leaves Mai in his care. Just after Jonouchi nods to this, Valon slumps to his side, and Mai calls out his name. But he is already unconscious, and the Seal closes in on him, beaming to the sky before leaving his body. Episode 111 - Bitter Victory\rDartz is monitoring everything. He sees Yugi, Kaiba, Mokuba and Rebecca climbing up the building trying to find him. He also has cameras outside looking at Honda and rest dueling against the police officers. And finally he has a camera in the parking lot nearby watching the duel of Valon and Jonouchi that has just ended. In the walls of the temple, a new tablet with the image of Valon appears. Dartz announces that it\u0026rsquo;s Mai\u0026rsquo;s turn next, and challenges her to show him the darkness in her heart. Mai bends down and hugs Valon\u0026rsquo;s body, crying and whispering his name. After a moment her eyes clear up, and she regains her breath, setting him down in the ground. She calls Jonouchi stupid for talking about duels like they can be shared, when they are really for oneself, grinning and saying that that\u0026rsquo;s why Valon lost. Jonouchi insists that Valon gave his best for that fight, and seeing as the seal glows briefly on her forehead, he realizes that there is only one way to reach her feelings and challenges her to a duel. Mai begins with a big offensive and Jonouchi struggles in response, still feeling the injuries from the previous duel. He now understands that, in his duel with Valon, they talked a lot, and not just with words. In doing so he sensed Valon\u0026rsquo;s heart, and that is why he also wants a serious duel with her. He hopes that she will understand him by the end of it, and he wants to understand her too. Speechless for a moment, Mai laughs at the idea he could understand her and keeps going. As they fight, the duel becomes more and more tense and Jonouchi is pushed against his back. Just as Mai was about to strike the final blow and condemn Jonouchi’s soul forever, she faltered. Her attack froze midair, confusion washing over her. She had believed that victory would prove she had finally escaped the shadows of her past and moved beyond her suffering. Yet deep down, she realized the truth: Marik had shattered her spirit, and though Dartz and the others offered her a distraction, she had never truly healed. Unlike Jonouchi, who fought while leaning on the support of his friends, she had been trying to carry her pain alone. Overcome by exhaustion, Jonouchi collapsed to the ground and, with a weak breath, declared Mai the winner. Mai rushes to him, memories of their friendship washing over her, and declares that she will not let his soul be taken. But Jonouchi says it\u0026rsquo;s too late and, still protecting her, pushes her out of the ever shrinking circle. In the process, his hand catches on Mai\u0026rsquo;s Orichalcos fragment and it gets removed, crumbling as the seal passes over it on its way to claim Jonouchi. As Mai\u0026rsquo;s fragment shatters, Dartz senses a powerful soul has been captured and the preparations are finally complete. Meanwhile, \u0026ldquo;Timaeus\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Critias\u0026rdquo; materialize from Yugi\u0026rsquo;s and Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s decks and cry in lament and mourning. In the duel monsters spirit world, Dark Magician Girl and other monsters are seen praying and suddenly the evil eye in the sky vanishes. But the sense of fear is even stronger now. Episode 112 - Fighting for a Friend\rMai cradles Jonouchi in her arms and starts crying, truly regretting what she\u0026rsquo;s done. She realizes that blaming Jonouchi and the rest for the loneliness and abandonment she felt was wrong. Now free of Dartz\u0026rsquo;s spell, she decides to go challenge him directly. As she leaves the place she picks up the \u0026ldquo;Hermos\u0026rdquo; card from the ground. Honda and the rest have dealt with the officers and run in the direction Jonouchi went, only to be stunned then they see Valon\u0026rsquo;s and Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s soul-less bodies sitting propped against the fence of that vacant lot. Honda takes him on his back and they all go back to the building. Mai goes on her motorcycle to the Doma building and enters with a special security key, going directly to the top floor looking for Dartz. There she encounters Rafael instead, talking with Dartz who is in a computer screen. Mai is angry at them for manipulating her mind, for increasing her evil thoughts with the orichalcos stone and card, and wants revenge on Dartz. He says that he only pushed her a bit in the direction that she desired, ensuring that doing so would make her strong. But she replies that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t strength what she gained, only hate. He ignores her anger and instead congratulates her, saying that due to her defeating Jonouchi they have finally concluded preparations and the god is about to be revived. She dismisses that and demands to know where he is. Rafael steps up, seeing that she is not listening to what they say, and challenges Mai to a duel. The two of them exchange blows and use their decks to the fullest. At one point Mai sees an opening and tries to go for the win by using the card she took from Jonouchi, but Hermos doesn\u0026rsquo;t respond to her summon. Rafael takes advantage of this to turn the duel around and win. She cries, asking Jonouchi for forgiveness. The seal of orichalcos encircles her. Yugi and the rest arrive and open the door only to have Mai\u0026rsquo;s soulless body collapse on him. Episode 113 - The Fated Duel! Yugi vs. Rafael\rRafael stands before Yugi and the rest. He tells them about what happened to Jonouchi, Valon and Mai. He is not moved by the losses of his companions, as he affirms that everything is part of fate. Dartz, from the computer screen, welcomes them to his building. Kaiba snaps up, demanding him to stop messing with his company and with Industrial Illusion. Dartz replies that he only did that to get him involved in this, as he needed strong duelists for his goal. But now, ever since acquiring Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s soul, the task has been completed. Rafael accuses the other Yugi of using his \u0026ldquo;other soul\u0026rdquo; to escape fate, but he won\u0026rsquo;t do it again, and challenges him to a duel. They battle, and this time the other Yugi is more calm and focused. He says that he won\u0026rsquo;t fall to the darkness and that he will bring back his partner. Rafael is the one to use the seal this time, gaining the upper hand. Kaiba knows that there\u0026rsquo;s more to the power of the \u0026ldquo;Seal\u0026rdquo;, and wonders if Yugi will be able to win back the lost title of \u0026ldquo;King of Games\u0026rdquo;. Rafael monsters, who he took so much care before, are now corrupted by the seal and way stronger. Yugi is pushed back but resists and fights back. At one point, Rafael\u0026rsquo;s treasured ace card is destroyed and replaced by a creature of darkness. He says that it is the personification of his own dark side. In this moment the other Yugi reflects on himself, on his actions. On how he may have been more ruthless in the past, having an actual dark side. But meeting Yugi and walking alongside him had changed him. After losing him, he first thought that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to know right or wrong without Yugi, but Yugi had taught him that he needed to learn compassion by himself and actually see the pain their opponents have. He can\u0026rsquo;t judge people by a single trait they have and has to see the bigger picture. It happened back in duelist kingdom with his duel with Kaiba, and it had happened again in his first duel with Rafael. It is in human nature to repeat mistakes, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t want it to repeat it anymore. That ruthless side of him was something that he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have, that he rejected, and he would fight against fate itself if needed to be the person his partner trusted. The cards respond to the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s determination, and he uses both Hermos and Timaeus to defeat Rafael, bringing the duel to a close. With this, Yugi have regained the title of \u0026ldquo;King of Games\u0026rdquo;. When the seal is about to take Rafael\u0026rsquo;s soul, the stone on his neck breaks and the seal also vanishes. Episode 114 - The Tragedy of Atlantis\rThe soul of Rafael has not been taken by the seal, something surprising to them all, including Rafael himself. He tells them how to reach Dartz: they need to get to the ground floor and then to a secret elevator that would lead them to a secret underground floor of the building. They go to the ground floor once again and they find Anzu and the rest there. Yugi looks at Jonouchi and promises that he will save him. Otogi, Arthur and Rebecca stay with Mai and Jonouchi while the rest go to the hidden elevator. They get to a large room containing tablets depicting the imprisoned souls. The other Yugi sees the tablets of Pegasus, Valon, Mai, Jonouchi and even Yugi himself, so he rushes forward but then Dartz\u0026rsquo;s shows up, welcoming them to his temple. Yugi replies that all his subordinates have been defeated, he is the only one left, but Dartz looks unfazed. He says that he always planned to have them be sacrifices to the seal. At this point he makes the whole set of torches light, thus revealing the whole room. Yugi and company gasp; the floor, walls and dome-shaped ceiling are filled with tablets of sealed souls. Dartz explains that he and his people has been busy, taking down duelists all over the world ever since invading Duelist Kingdom and creating the \u0026ldquo;Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo; cards. Yugi demands to know who he really is, and Dartz smiles. He reveals that he is like him, like the Pharaoh: a ruler from the ancient past, the last king of Atlantis. He was dormant in the shattered pieces of the orichalcos for hundreds of years, and only regained conscious a year ago when the ruins of Atlantis were discovered. When a wealthy individual made a purchase of the stones in a black market auction, he possessed that man and took control of his business named \u0026ldquo;Doma\u0026rdquo;. Dartz narrates the history of Atlantis: it was a peaceful city in which harvests were copious, there was no greed or vanity. People lived in harmony. They had learned from the ancient Egyptians and other civilizations about the Duel Monster spirits and managed to comunicate with them, living in peace and learning from one another. Dartz, who had a wife and daughter, became the king when his father, Ironheart, resigned due to age. However one day a volcano erupted and stones rained down on the city: Orichalcos was born. Dartz shows them a vision of all of this, explaining that it the orichalcos was a treasure granted to them by Earth itself. The mineral could become energy, and thus great technological advances were made in the city. But as quickly as they evolved they also met their demise. The orichalcos poisoned people\u0026rsquo;s hearts and chaos ensued. The inhabitants started to become \u0026ldquo;monsters\u0026rdquo;. Even Dartz was forced to slay his wife once she became an ugly beast. Countless blood was shed that day. Confused, Dartz sensed a powerful energy coming from an Orichalcos fragment: it turned his left eye into its current turquoise color and shown a vision of a gigantic serpent-like creature pulsating inside of the Earth itself. He claims that he then understood everything: Orichalcos wasn\u0026rsquo;t a miraculous material. It was a test issued to them from the Earth itself, no, from the monsters on that other world, and they failed it. It was meant to amplify the \u0026lsquo;Dark\u0026rsquo; inside of humans. He claims that the humans would end up self-destructing themselves. He then took control of the army and started slaying all the corrupt humans. He didn\u0026rsquo;t stop there, that night he and his men controlled by the power of the orichalcos stormed every house in the city, killing everyone they deemed \u0026ldquo;corrupt\u0026rdquo;. His goal was simple: the Duel Monster Spirit world and the Human world should stay separated. So he needed to purge all existing connections between them. His father Ironheart escaped with his granddaughter and requested help from the world of Duel Monsters Spirits, which led to the battle that involved the three legendary dragons and the defeat of the Orichalcos God. However that battle destroyed Atlantis in its entirely, and the powerful volcano eruptions that came after it resulted in the city being buried in the ocean. Dartz tell them that when Atlantis fell, even when his body crumbled his own spirit endured in the last remnants of orichalcos. Once he resurfaced, he learned about how the powerful games of old had been recreated into Duel Monsters, and so in turn the bridge between worlds had been open once again. So, he decided to bring back his Orichalcos God within that game and use it to destroy it from within. But he needed something first: a way for the orichalcos mineral to influence the Duel Monsters game itself. That\u0026rsquo;s why he stormed Duelist Kingdom and created the \u0026ldquo;Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo; cards using his own soul for them. He also decided to split those orichalcos fragments and gave them to an army of duelists that would follow his orders. Dartz then comment on something else he discovered: Pegasus had already turned his god into a card. This comment actually shocks Yugi and Kaiba. Dartz says that instead of being one card, Pegasus had used his god\u0026rsquo;s strength and created multiple cards out of it, something he called \u0026ldquo;Wicked Gods\u0026rdquo;. Artificial creatures that were incomplete forms of the true power. He only learned about this after hearing from Yako Tenma\u0026rsquo;s actions against Yugi and his friends. He used the attack on Duelist Kingdom to also prove himself against these false atlantean gods, but apparently neither Yako nor his brother had them anymore so they weren\u0026rsquo;t a challenge to him after all. Then, with the \u0026ldquo;Seal of Orichalcos\u0026rdquo; cards already made, Dartz dispatched duelists all over the world, led by Rafael, Amelda and Valon, and they started to capture duelist souls into the cards. In doing so, they would feed the necessary duelist energy to resurrect his god. The final step of the plan was to use the actual most powerful cards in existance: the Egyptian Gods as the main source of energy for the ritual, which is why he left Yugi and his friends as the final targets of his plan. Stealing those cards was the only way, as a direct confrontation would have resulted in a loss. Dartz then smiles and claims that now he has succeeded, and the card of the orichalcos god lies in his deck, ready to devour his next victim. Episode 115 - The Decisive Battle! Dartz vs. Yugi \u0026amp; Kaiba\rKaiba announces that he shall be Dartz opponent, but Yugi refuses to let him go solo. They do a tag duel and Dartz agrees. During the fight, Dartz proves to be an incredibly skilled duelist and shows them the true strength of the orichalcos, powering the seal up. Their teamwork is not ideal but they are both really skilled too, so the match is even. At one point Dartz uses the souls he captured as puppets in the duel, creating \u0026ldquo;Mirror Knights\u0026rdquo; with the faces of Yugi, Mai, Pegasus and Jonouchi. The Pharaoh is unable to fight them in fear of hurting them, but Kaiba snaps out of it and the two of them together manage to get the advantage. But Dartz deck was well prepared and made a counter to the attack. It is at this point that Rafael finally breaks into the room and pleads of Dartz to stop this: he doesn\u0026rsquo;t see a point on it anymore. Dartz looks amused, while Rafael claims that Yugi helped him get rid of the \u0026ldquo;dark\u0026rdquo; in his heart. Dartz laughs, claiming that is impossible, as some darkness will always remain. He says that humans are, generally, evil. And they must be kept separated from the powers from that other world. While he doesn\u0026rsquo;t really need to keep capturing souls, he is happy to do so to further fuel the power of his god card. Rafael joins the battle against Dartz and makes an impressive initial move, but Dartz simply says that the seal of orichalcos hasn\u0026rsquo;t taken his soul yet because he wasn\u0026rsquo;t filled darkness or hate anymore. Then asks, what is he feeling now towards him? The seal forms on Rafael\u0026rsquo;s foreheads and turns his cards into a dark version. The energy suddenly goes out of control and Rafael\u0026rsquo;s collapses, his soul seized by the seal. A slate fills up with Rafael\u0026rsquo;s picture and Dartz laughs. The battle continues and Dartz proves to be too strong. Kaiba falls but not before he does a move to help Yugi. Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s soul is seized and appears on the tablet, while Mokuba screams his brother\u0026rsquo;s name. Within a strange space, countless bubbles containing seized souls float down towards an ominous eye. Yugi and Jonouchi awaken. They are greeted by Pegasus. Jonouchi realizes that if Kaiba is with them, then he must have lost. Yugi trusts that the Pharaoh can defeat Dartz, but Jonouchi is rather unsure. Pegasus claims that there\u0026rsquo;s one hope left: the card he gave to them. He narrates about how he\u0026rsquo;d researched a lot of ruins across the world when creating the Duel Monsters game. When he originally made the concept for the Wicked Gods, and specially after learning from Yako what happened during the R.A. Project, he started his research and ended up learning about the legend of Timaeus, Hermos and Critias. He heard of the three Legendary Dragons and thought it to be very mysterious. After researching their origins, Pegasus had come to the conclusion that the dragons had once been human, and they held the secret power to face that ancient threat. Dartz finally manages to summon his god, the powerful \u0026ldquo;Wicked God Gê\u0026rdquo;. A giant serpent with infinite attack. It seems that it is too much for even the Pharaoh to handle, but he draws the nameless card that Pegasus left for them, which transform into \u0026ldquo;Legend of the Heart\u0026rdquo; and in turn changes the three legendary dragon cards into human form. The knights are strong and are designed to work against the Wicked God, but they need time and Yugi doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be able to last one extra turn. It is at this point that Anzu of all people joins the duel, to everyone\u0026rsquo;s surprise. She says that her deck is calling her to intercede, and summons \u0026ldquo;The Wicked Avatar\u0026rdquo; to the field, which shocks Yugi and the rest even more. She tells them that she felt a connection with that card ever since the incident in the Kaiba Corporation building, and ended up recovering the card and keeping it to herself. Due to the weird things that happened back then, she became attuned to the wicked card and could hear it. Even talk to it. Yugi warns her that the card is evil, but she insists that it is not anymore, and that she will use it to help him win the duel and rescue their friends together. The two Wicked Gods clash, and the Wicked God Gê proves to be stronger. But that clash has given Yugi enough time to use his Legendary Knights. With a combined strike, he overcomes infinity and delivers the final blow to the Wicked God, to Dartz horror. The orichalcos barrier breaks and Dartz himself starts to crumble, dissolving into dust. The stone tablets in the walls start to become empty as the souls of the people return. Kaiba wakes up while Mokuba cries in relief. Haga and Ryuzaki wake up and hug each other while crying. Rafael, Valon and Amelda also wake up, having watched the duel through that strange space. Jonouchi and Mai do the same, smiling to each other. Yugi reunites with the Pharaoh and talk with him in his mind. Dark Magician Girl appears before them within his mind too, along with the three Legendary Knights Timaeus, Hermos, and Critias. She thanks them for their help: with the destruction of the wicked god their world has been saved. Yugi goes to the ritual platform and finally recovers the three god cards. After that, the whole group steps out of the building to see a new dawn.

The Egyptian Gods are here!"},{"content":"Hello Duelists, we have a large update today. After completing all the sets related to the Museum Arc it was clear that some things were working and some things were not. We are making some structural and quality-of-life changes to the game based on what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned. The goal with these changes is to keep improving the rulebook and new-player-onboarding, eliminating inconsistencies, and building a solid structure for future cards.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;ve already printed cards, don\u0026rsquo;t worry! the large majority of these changes are related to Rule Cards and rulings in general that exist outside of the cards themselves. 90% of the cards won\u0026rsquo;t be impacted at all by this other than the id-number changing.\nSize and Frequency of Set Releases\rBefore the Museum Arc we established a 70-card set limit to better accomodate Tabletop Simulator releases. This didn\u0026rsquo;t yield great results, so we\u0026rsquo;re reverting to a structure closer to what we had before. Releasing 7 sets per arc also came with its own problems, mainly in: properly slotting story duels and character cards, a feeling of too-much-filler per set, lack of impact and wasting too much time dealing with Tabletop Simulator instead of using that time to create more cards.\nThe reality is that card development needs to speed up: it took me about 7-months to release sets #8 to #14, which is way too slow. We are now aiming to have 2 sets per arc instead of 7, removing the card limit for each set.\nFewer releases per year gives both players and myself some breathing room. It also allows for larger-scale design projects without constantly needing to patch older sets due to new mechanics. The goal is of-course to reduce the 7-months-per-arc with this, because otherwise we are looking at almost 2 years to complete the Duel Monster adaptation, and that to me feels too much.\nThis approach is closer to traditional game releases, which feature much larger sets (eg. for draft formats). Each set here will probably contain roughly 150–250 cards, themed around the arc\u0026rsquo;s story, but not necessarily locked to exactly half of the arc\u0026rsquo;s chapters.\nMain issue with this change would be the lack of the monthly card previews, but i hope to keep \u0026rsquo;em rolling ocassionally (even if their are more \u0026ldquo;work in progress\u0026rdquo; than nowadays) and introduce other ways for you guys to feel involved in the project as we go.\nIn conclusion: 2 sets per Arc instead of 7 (to be implemented with the first Battle City set, and applied retroactively).\nRulebook Changes\rHierarchy: After some dicussion, the natural protection rule is being removed from divine cards to go in-line with the changes we made to types/traits last year. The Hierarchy only serves now as a value that can be referenced by card effects.\nThe Hierarchy Scale is also being adjusted from a 1–10 range to a 1–7 range. Cards will be adjusted accordingly.\nTokens now belong to the Extra Deck and should be considered during deckbuilding. Not a lot changes here other than them having a proper place.\nNew terminology \u0026ldquo;Combination Cards\u0026rdquo;: a rulebook term that unifies Spell Traps, Spell Monsters and Trap Monsters. This is only for clarity and has no effect on gameplay or card text.\nEmblem cards were removed, as they served no purpose really.\nCard Type Clarifications: In the rulebook we are adjusting the card types to be more consistent and avoid confusion:\nMain Card Type (one of the four main types of cards in the game, each card has to have at least one of these: Rule, Spell, Trap, Monster). Advanced Card Type (used as a prefix with the main type, they introduce new mechanics and special interactions, they are: Fusion, Ritual, Equip, Continuous, Setup, Divine, etc.) Secondary Card Type (they do nothing on their own but can be used for other card effects, they include all the monster types (beast, spellcaster, poisoned, toon, etc.), hierarchy value, divine pantheon, rule types, etc.) Text Effect Clarity: Some quality of life changes like normalizing italics as flavor text for effect names, changing the charge cost of symbols or replacing the words with underscore with all caps words which are called \u0026ldquo;effect types\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nSpell \u0026amp; Trap Speed Changes: While most Continuous and Equip cards are Slow Effects (like it says in the rules) this is not universal. Persist cards are usually Quick, and Normal spells are also sometimes Slow. This ends up being confusing. We are now introducing the \u0026ldquo;Slow\u0026rdquo; card type, which directly states the speed of the card\u0026rsquo;s activation as Slow Speed. This change removes redundant text in the effect box and reduces confusion about which cards can be played quickly and which cannot. The new rule basically says: All Spell and Trap cards are Quick Speed unless they are marked as \u0026ldquo;Slow.\u0026rdquo;\nPersist \u0026amp; Continuous: With the addition of the Slow card type, card speed is now more clearly defined and therefore we are removing the \u0026ldquo;Persist\u0026rdquo; type, integrating it into Continuous Spell/Trap cards. The \u0026ldquo;Continuous\u0026rdquo; condition will now be explicitly written in the textbox (\u0026ldquo;Persists until\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;). If nothing is stated, the card remains on the field indefinitely. This unification makes our card types more consistent and easier to explain to new players.\nSingleton: Now that we have more cards, we are finally fulfiling on this promise and are changing the deckbuilding rules to become \u0026ldquo;singleton\u0026rdquo;. This means a player can only have 1 copy of each card in the Main Deck. That said, the rules also allow players to have 1 card with up to 3 copies and 1 card with up to 2 copies. This, combined with the \u0026ldquo;Surplus\u0026rdquo; section of the Restricted List, should make deckbuilding more in line with the original vision of the game: losing deck consistency for variety, while keeping some strong core cards consistent.\nRule Card Changes\rOne of the main culprits of the amount of set filler that we saw was the overabundance of Rule Cards. Specifically the amount of similar-looking Duelist Setup Rule cards that dilute the whole set with uninteresting cards that end up being skipped over when looking at a new set. For this reason we made some big changes to the whole structure of Rule Cards to present them in a better way for all players:\nNormal Rule Cards\rFor normal Rule Cards we replaced the two concepts of \u0026ldquo;KEYWORD\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;RELIANCE\u0026rdquo; with a single concept \u0026ldquo;EVENT\u0026rdquo;. Now, Normal Rule Cards will all work the same way: \u0026ldquo;if the EVENT condition is true you can activate this card to the Rule Zone, if it stops being true then this card returns to the Extra Deck\u0026rdquo;.\nSome examples of Event conditions could now be: \u0026ldquo;there is a ??? monster on the field\u0026rdquo; (which replaces the KEYWORD mechanic), or \u0026ldquo;you control ??? card\u0026rdquo; (replacing the RELIANCE mechanic), or even \u0026ldquo;you played ??? card\u0026rdquo; (for the RELIANCE mechanic that works in activation only).\nThis will make the whole concept more clear and connected without having to re-check what the heck are the RELIANCE/KEYWORD or how they work.\nSetup Rule Cards\rSetup Rule now all work the same way: they can only be activated in the Setup Phase. That\u0026rsquo;s it, that\u0026rsquo;s the main thing they do. Further clasifications like Duelist, Field or Challenge have their own explanations below but are more tied to the card effect itself and not directly to the type. This way we avoid confusion and Setup specific sub-rules to keep track of during the game.\nChallenge Setup Rule Cards\rGame Setup Rules have been combined into Challenge Setup Rules. They no longer have a limitation of playing only one of them per game. They still change how the game is played in a big way, and many of them will have a requirement to be accepted by all players in order to be played, but it is not a mandatory clause in the card type anymore which was limiting design-space.\nField Setup Rule Cards\rFor clarity-sake we are changing the underlined \u0026ldquo;Terrain:\u0026rdquo; word with \u0026ldquo;TERRAINS:\u0026rdquo; to keep it consistent with other effect types. A player can only activate one \u0026ldquo;TERRAINS\u0026rdquo; effect in the Setup Phase.\nWe are also removing the Matched Field mechanic (and duplicate cards that used them), replacing it with specific Field cards that allow a player to choose either Red or Blue side. This way a player could still pick a Matched Field (like the duel arenas in the anime) and maybe have their opponent pick the other side, without requiring both players to have the same card.\nDuelist Setup Rule Cards\rAfter extensive review we\u0026rsquo;ve concluded that Duelist Setups are flawed as a concept. They feel irrelevant to the actual gameplay, despite attempts to add more functionality to them over time (which resulted in a different problem of them trying to do too many things at once):\n(1): They try to reference the anime duels, listing every card each character played. This leads to a large number of them per set. As the game expands, the main cast will accumulate more and more of these cards (most of which will end up being very similar). Visually, the artwork also becomes repetitive due to the recurring use of the same character image. (2): They aim to ignore the Restricted List, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of control over which card is included because they are linked to the anime duel, making it impossible to edit or update later if needed unless we change the duel. (3): They aim to manipulate the starting hand, but with so many Duelist Setups available per player, there\u0026rsquo;s no clear logic on which one to include in a deck. Some setups will always be better than others simply for listing more useful cards. The main problem is that they lack a clear purpose. If you want to make a Yugi deck\u0026hellip; which Duelist Setup do you pick? Does it even matter? Do you have to check what he played in each duel and see if any of it is useful for your starting hand? If we feel like this with ~20 Yugi cards, what will happen when we have ~60 of them?\nSo, from now on, Duelist Setups will no longer reference individual anime duels. Instead, they\u0026rsquo;ll focus solely on their two functional roles: Restricted List Protection and Starting Hand Manipulation.\nThe underlined \u0026ldquo;Cardlist\u0026rdquo; concept is replaced with STRATEGY, which will still include a list of cards, but curated by us and centered around a specific strategy for each duelist. A player can only activate one \u0026ldquo;STRATEGY\u0026rdquo; effect in the Setup Phase.\nAlso, each Duelist Setup will now feature unique artwork to make them easier to identify, maintaining the visual idea of different outfits or themes we\u0026rsquo;ve used so far. Ideally, a new Duelist Setup should only be created when a duelist refines or adopts a different strategy, not for every single duel (since duelists don\u0026rsquo;t usually change their decks between duels). For example, for Pegasus, we could have something like \u0026ldquo;STRATEGY (Toon Mayhem):\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and another card with \u0026ldquo;STRATEGY (Illusionism):\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWith these changes, we aim to reduce the number of Duelist Setups significantly, keeping only those that offer meaningful and interesting options for players.\nSymbol Rule Cards\rPreviously we talked about removing Emblems from the game. In truth what we are doing is combining Emblems into Symbols. They will remain as an entirely optional card sub-type to use, but they now will have the light-yellow frame of the Emblems so it will be easier to distinguish them from the regular Rule cards in the Extra Deck.\nTheir mechanics will remain the same, but we will be aiming to design them to be more experimental, with effects that go beyond the regular game. Expect some 4th-wall breaking and effects more similar to Un-sets from MTG with these type of cards.\nExpansion Sets (Community Cards)\rWe\u0026rsquo;ll soon be kicking off the process to create the first Expansion Set: a chance for the community to design cards to be included in the game! I\u0026rsquo;ll be preparing the plan for this in the coming weeks.\nTL;DR:\r2 sets per story arc instead of 7, with no limit on amount of cards per set. Less frequent set releases but more impactful. Hierarchy has no natural protection anymore, the scale is changed to 1-7. Tokens go to the Extra Deck now. Card types reorganized, some were removed and some were added. For example the \u0026ldquo;Slow\u0026rdquo; type was added for spell and traps to make it easier to see when a card is Slow Speed or not. \u0026ldquo;Persist\u0026rdquo; cards are transformed into \u0026ldquo;Continuous\u0026rdquo; cards which can now have the Persist clarification in the textbox. Singleton rule for deckbuilding (with some exceptions). Normal Rule cards have EVENT replacing both KEYWORD and RELIANCE. Setup Rules simplified. Game Setup are combined into Challenge Setup Rules. Matched Fields removed. TERRAINS as an effect can be picked by the other player (replacing Matched fields). Duelist Setups will be revamped, focusing on STRATEGY effects instead of anime duels tracking. Symbol Rules are now light-yellow and have been combined with Emblems, focusing on weird and optional gameplay. We will start working on community sets soon.

I wanted to make a small blog post about the design of the Museum Arc. This is a look into choices made during the Yugioh Scrolls and Kingdom Duels development for those that want to check these things out.\nThe Storytelling\rEp 41: I wanted to expand on some potential Duelist Kingdom duels that we missed. I think the idea of recapping/revisiting a previous arc was nice, and probably something to explore in the future. Ep 42: To me it was important to flesh out Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s conflict with the Big Five, but didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to have Yugi and the group here with the whole \u0026ldquo;Legendary Heroes\u0026rdquo; arc as it was going to feel a bit repetitive with the upcoming Virtual World, so I focused more on Kaiba and Mokuba to deal with this treat. Ep 43: Not much changed here from the original show, but a few links to the Museum are established. Ep 44-45: As the focus is on Kingdom Duels, i wanted to adapt Dungeon Dice Monsters to it while keeping the idea as close as possible. The duel itself ended up really similar, so that was great. Ep 46: I needed the group to meet Shizuka early so this was a good chance for it, as they all visit the museum together for the Egyptian Exhibition and problems start to come up. Ep 47-52: Now that we had Otogi and Shizuka in the group, it was time to introduce the Virtual World subplot. I kept it mostly the same but with some changes to the duels and contained to one duel per episode. The structure is roughly the same, but the power level was toned down. I took the opportunity to give side-characters a few more interesting game decisions. Ep 53-57: The second half of this subarc is a bit different, as it is more focused and involves a huge multi-duel that gives the side-character once again a time to shine. It was also more focused on Kaiba taking down both Noah and Gozaburo, so Yugi didn\u0026rsquo;t had the same pivotal role as he did in the anime, which i think was better because this was mostly Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s subplot. Ep 58-59: I wanted to include Shadi\u0026rsquo;s action from the manga/toei series here, and it lined up pretty well with the rest of the plot. His actions against the curator, professor and yugi\u0026rsquo;s friend make him a more complex pseudo-antagonist that what he was in the show. We had a brief introduction of a character that will be important later on. Ep 60-61: Now the plot starts to connect to the egyptian mythos and the upcoming Battle City arc thanks to the involvement of Ishizu and Marik in these two episodes. Ep 62-63: I wanted to keep Anzu\u0026rsquo;s date with the Other Yugi, but making the small chance of having her fight Johnny Steps which i think works a bit better. I then took the opportunity of have the Other Yugi have a longer encounter with Ishizu, even dueling a bit in their minds as a sort of test, which goes in line with every Millennium Item user we had. Ep 64-65: Obelisk had to be kept a secret so i think not revealing his abilities works better when Kaiba duels the computer. The tournament is announced, which is the main link to the next arc, but then we follow Bakura go into the museum. While this was barely seen in the anime, in here i gave it a lot more of an importance as I feel an encounter with Ishizu, Bakura and Shadi could have been really interesting to see at this point. Revealing more of Shadi\u0026rsquo;s backstory while showcasing Bakura\u0026rsquo;s power was also the idea to make him a bit more threatening. Game Design Thoughts (by Set Release)\rLoose Ends\rI started things off with this very first set. It was the first time of me designing cards like these, essentially leaving the comfort of keeping anime mechanics 1-to-1 and exploring new design spaces. I liked this set, even though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as flashy as the others that we had later in this arc, it established a good foundation and gave support to things that could have happened in Duelist Kingdom.\nDungeon of Luck\rThis was an insane set to design. Rewriting the Dungeon Dice Monsters rules into this game was a monumental task, specially on the tracking aspect of the duel (every move, every combat, every effect, every positional change, how they shape their dice, etc.). Really fun though, and it gave me the chance to consolidate the Labyrinth mechanic from the original arc even further, creating the whole concept of Tilemaps and Tiles using the artwork of the card, which i really liked.\nVirtual Nightmare, Body Snatchers and Facing the Past\rI have to put these three sets together in this section because they share the narrative and the spotlight in a condensed way. The main focus here was obviously the Deckmaster system. It was challenging to design because it was super weird and it really tested the basic rules.\nI wanted to stay true to the idea that the mechanics have to adapt to our game and not fundamentally change it. The easy route would have been to add a special \u0026ldquo;Deckmaster\u0026rdquo; slot and card type but i refused to change the original gameboard by adding a new zone. So i had to find a different way.\nI thought about an Extra Deck Summoning mechanic for Deckmasters, but given that the whole idea was about using \u0026ldquo;any\u0026rdquo; monster as a Deckmaster, and the story already included Alters and Fusions as Deckmasters, the idea of a new summoning mechanic wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been a true \u0026ldquo;unique\u0026rdquo; summoning mechanic. It would also end up confined to only these 3 sets because we never saw the Deckmaster concept ever again.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why i used Rule Cards instead, which ended up working pretty well and have an inherent protection that is useful here. I had the opportunity to play a bit with the Erosion mechanic, which is meant to remain different to the Banish in Yugioh and i totally intend for it to stay that way. Luckily the whole thing ended up working pretty well.\nThat said, a different problem arose in this arc: As the Virtual World originally aired between the two Battle City halfs, it had a lot of cards that in the anime debuted during Battle City (like Dark Magician Girl or Gearfried). I felt that introducing those cards here would lessen the impact they had in their very first duels in the Battle City Arc, so I ended up making quite a lot of changes in the duels trying to keep the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; cards like those to the minimum. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t always possible to do (like with Jinzo) but i think overall it worked out.\nSpeaking of, it was here in these three sets that we started seeing the importance of the Ritual Summoning mechanic going forward as the main replacement of the Tribute Summons. Given that we won\u0026rsquo;t have the Regular / Battle City Rules we had to pivot to the Ritual mechanic for the big and gamechanging monsters.\nA final note is that this virtual sub-arc gave me the chance to play and design a lot with Terrains too, so it was a more natural progression between the heavy Terrain-focus of Duelist Kingdom and the more urban environment of dueling in Battle City.\nMillennium Legacy and Spirit of the Puzzle\rThese were super cool sets to work on because they have a ton of cards and mechanics completely new that i had to create mostly from scratch. Thematically we are really focusing now in the museum itself. Having Ishizu, Marik, Shadi and Bakura all linked together in these two sets was really important going forward, as focusing on the millennium item wielders was what i wanted the most for this arc.\nMechanically, the idea of Subduels was really fitting for Shadi\u0026rsquo;s mind manipulations given that we never saw him duel in the original show. As someone who always loved the idea of those video game yugioh puzzles of \u0026ldquo;win in 1 turn\u0026rdquo; i was quite pleased with bringing that idea into the game itself.\nThe Diaha rule mechanic was also a tricky one to design because it requires to plan ahead and to leave a lot of design space open, as it will be relevant in 3 arcs from here and that\u0026rsquo;s a long time. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what\u0026rsquo;s the game and the story is going to look at that point, but i hope this works well.\nI wanted to respect the idea of the cards coming from egyptian stone tablets, while also tying it a bit more to the Ritual Mechanic, which i think feels natural as the replacement for the Tribute Mechanic in this game. Having Rituals take the spotlight like this is, in my mind, also fitting for this DM era as the core Extra Deck mechanic of the time (just as Fusions for GX, Synchros for 5Ds, etc.)\nShortcomings\rThere were few specific areas that I didn\u0026rsquo;t like during design. One of them is that I felt that we had a lot of filler cards in the form of an ever expanding list of Duelist Setup cards. I feel that having so many of them dilutes (a bit) the cool factor of the Rule cards themselves.\nThe decision of how we release the Duelist Setup cards is what causes this, as they themselves are a list of what cards each duelist played in each duel, so its a design choice to have them be like this, and they will grow a lot in the future. Personally i dont like that it ends up resulting in so many similar cards that see little play at all. They are a bit confusing too, for example if one would want to make a Yugi deck, which duelist setup should he choose? there are 20 of them to pick, and they are mostly similar. Does it matter? Should you pick any of them?\nAnother problem i saw was\u0026hellip; dividing the sets into 7 ended up making the whole process too slow in my opinion. It took around 7 months to release sets #8 to #14, and at that pace we are looking to complete Duel Monsters at a total of 35 sets in around 2 years, which to me feels too far-away. This is on me, I need to do better.\nFinal Words\rIn the end, i really enjoyed working on the Museum Arc. It gave me the opportunity of adapting interesting mechanics and fleshing out what the Kingdom Duels rulebook is capable of. There were a lot of challenging decisions and interactions that i had to figure it out, while also trying to not go overboard with the changes to both the story and the duels.\nThe storyline of the arc itself could have been a bit more related to the \u0026ldquo;Museum\u0026rdquo; itself but that was going to be difficult because its trying to do a bit too many things and stretching over a bunch of different plot points. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird to call it \u0026ldquo;Museum Arc\u0026rdquo; when so many different things happen, but i\u0026rsquo;m okay with that and i tried to relate the major stuff to the Museum whenever i had the chance (including the virtual sub-arc).\nWhile i took the time for experimenting and adapting weird ideas, i look ahead and see in Battle City the opportunity to return to the core of the project and expand the main mechanics, focusing more on the base experience which will be good for everyone i hope.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s it for me! Thank you for reading this far, and into Battle City we go!\n","date":"2025-06-15T14:21:00-03:00","image":"https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0029.jpg","permalink":"https://kingdomduels.com/post/retrospective-museum-arc/","title":"Retrospective - Museum Arc"},{"content":"Spirit of the Puzzle is the new set that has been released in Kingdom Duels on 2025-06-15.\nBreakdown\rCodename: [SPZ] It has 64 cards from episodes 61 to 65 of the Yugioh Scrolls project, and it concludes the Museum Arc by bringing the Millennium Item wielders to the spotlight.

Having them in a square size, while serviceable for Tabletop Simulator and visually more cool for promotional material, has been a bit of a problem for actual physical play. Their odd size means that you can\u0026rsquo;t really pack them into a deckbox and need to carry them separately.\nSo, we have been testing card-sized, horizontal, borderless terrains just like you can see in the image:\nThe text is centered so its easier to read. And now playing a card on top of them does not cover the actual effect if you place them a bit upwards. Honestly the main benefit is their new size, which is card-size like all other cards: being able to slot them in a regular deckbox instead of having to keep them separated was the main focus of this change.\nThese will be the new Terrain Markers going forward, and the previous square-sized Terrains will be replaced. We will be updating all promotional material and rulebook with the new images in the coming weeks.\nField Power Bonus\rEvery Terrain will now have between 1 and 3 Monster Types that it gives Field Power Bonus. Previously there were some Terrains with 0 types, and some with 4 or more.\nWe felt that having at least one type (except for the \u0026ldquo;Land\u0026rdquo; terrain which is the default) is a good way to reinforce the design of cards around this iconic mechanic from Duelist Kingdom. Also, having more than 3 was a bit more problematic to keep track and remember while playing, so this is a nice balance between the two options.\n","date":"2025-05-17T14:40:00-03:00","image":"https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0026.jpg","permalink":"https://kingdomduels.com/post/terrain-changes/","title":"Terrain Changes"},{"content":"\n\u0026ldquo;A new tournament arises: Battle City. Organized by Seto Kaiba, it gathers elite Duelists from all over Japan and introduces impressive new technology that would turn Domino City itself into a battleground. As Yugi enters the competition, he must face powerful foes and dark powers, all while uncovering secrets about the ancient Millennium Items and the mysterious Egyptian God Cards.\u0026rdquo;\nAuthor\u0026rsquo;s Note: My main goal here was to properly adapt the beloved Battle City arc to the Kingdom Duels ruleset, trying to preserve as much as possible from the original duels while also taking advantage of the fact that the Virtual World arc was moved ahead in the timeline so both the Battle City and the Battle City Finals can take place in a single arc as it should have been in the original anime release.\nChapters\rSetting\rTimeline\rDuels\rCharacters\r← Previous Arc The Millennium Chapter Next Arc → List of Episodes\r66\r67\r68\r69\r70\r71\r72\r73\r74\r75\r76\r77\r78\r79\r80\r81\r82\r83\r84\r85\r86\r87\r88\r89\r90\rEpisode 66 - Stalked by the Ghouls\rThe Battle City tournament is less than a week away. Jonouchi learns about the tournament from Yugi and Anzu, and decides to join in to help Yugi, despite their warning about Kaiba having a grudge against him. At the registration office, Yugi is well-qualified to enter the tournament, but when Jonouchi tries to sign up, he finds out his ranking is too low. However, the clerk notices Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Rarest Card is the \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo;, something the Ghouls (Rare Hunters) would like to get their hands on. The clerk then secretly changes Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s ranking so that it is high enough and tells him he is qualified, that Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;incorrect\u0026rdquo; ranking was due to a computer glitch. The clerk then issues Yugi and Jonouchi their Duel Disks, and although they had used a prototype of them before in the virtual world, these are the real deal. Shortly after Yugi and his friends leave, the shop clerk calls the Ghouls to tell them that he found a nice catch. That evening, Jonouchi splits from everyone else to go to the hospital to visit Shizuka, who is about to get her eye operation. He is confronted by three Ghouls. One of them forces him into a duel. The Rare Hunter tells him that if he loses, he must give up his \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo;. During the duel, the opponent plays defensively until he draws all five pieces of \u0026ldquo;Exodia\u0026rdquo; and wins. The group of Ghouls then beat Jonouchi up and take his Red-Eyes as per the stakes of the duel. The next morning, Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s mother calls Yugi, saying that he never showed up at the hospital. Yugi, Honda, and Anzu search for him. Honda, riding his motorcycle, finds him at a beach. After some words and blows are exchanged between the two, Honda takes Jonouchi to the hospital. Apparently after getting beat-up, Jonouchi was angry of having lost his Card and thought he couldn\u0026rsquo;t face his younger sister. He helps Shizuka get the confidence she needs to go through with her operation. Jonouchi is determined to get his \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo; back from the Ghouls. Episode 67 - Fierce Fight! Battle City Begins\rThe entire city is filled with duelists to the surprise of ordinary people. Yugi wonders what is the meaning of the puzzle card that came up with his Duel Disk. He bumps into Mai, Haga, Ryuzaki and Kajiki before splitting up, as each will try to find a location that would benefit their own decks. Kaiba announces the start of the Battle City, detailing the rules and stating that the finals will be in a hidden place. To find where it is there the participants need to get 6 puzzle cards. There are 48 participants in the tournament, all ranked on level 5 or higher, so only 8 duelists can reach the finals. Yugi and Jonouchi start moving around as everybody else does. Jonouchi spots the Rare Hunter who took his \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo; and challenges him to an ante Duel so that he will be able to win it back. The Rare Hunter refuses to Duel him, but wants to duel Yugi to get his \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo;. Yugi agrees to the battle on the condition that should he win, the Rare Hunter should hand back Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo;. As the duel starts, Jonouchi tries to tell Yugi about the Rare Hunter\u0026rsquo;s strategy, but Yugi tells him not to say so, as it would be unfair. At Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s control center, Kaiba and Mokuba watch the very first duel taking place. Kaiba is informed that Yugi\u0026rsquo;s opponent is one of the Ghouls who had hacked themselves into the Kaiba Corporation mainframe to enlist themselves as participants. Hearing this, Mokuba tries to go and stop the duel and disqualify him, but Kaiba refrains him from doing so, as he wants the other Egyptian God Cards from them. During the duel, Yugi deduces the Rare Hunter\u0026rsquo;s strategy to summon \u0026ldquo;Exodia\u0026rdquo; and devises a strategy of his own to counter it. After winning the Duel he takes \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo; and destroys the Rare Hunter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Exodia\u0026rdquo; cards after realizing they were all counterfeit. At that point the Rare Hunter posture and demeanor changes: he is being controlled from afar with the power of the Millennium Rod. Yugi is greeted by the man doing the possession, named Marik, who addresses him as \u0026ldquo;Pharaoh\u0026rdquo; and declares that the Pharaoh will be destroyed with the help of one of his Egyptian God Cards. When Yugi tries to return \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes\u0026rdquo; to Jonouchi, he refuses, saying Yugi won \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes\u0026rdquo; fair and square. Jonouchi intends to use the Battle City tournament as a chance to strengthen and improve himself and become a \u0026ldquo;True Duelist\u0026rdquo; like Yugi himself. When the time comes, he plans to challenge Yugi to a friendly duel in an attempt to win \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes\u0026rdquo; from his friend. They shake hands and depart in opposite directions just when Anzu was finally arriving to the place they were. Episode 68 - Esper Roba - Danger of the Psychic Deck\rDuring his patroll, Mokuba spots the kid who had the star chips that he stole back in duelist kingdom. He apologizes profusely to him about what happened and wishes him the best of luck during the tournament. The kid accept his apologize and even gifts him a few of his own cards. They depart in amicable terms, and Mokuba relieved about it. Wanting to find a worthy opponent to duel, Jonouchi arrives just in time to watch Esper Roba (a duelist claiming to have psychic powers) defeat Dinosaur Ryuzaki. As per the Battle City Rules, Ryuzaki had to give up his \u0026ldquo;Serpent Night Dragon\u0026rdquo; to Roba as it was his rarest card. Roba, knowing Jonouchi was the runner-up in Duelist Kingdom, challenges him to a duel and he accepts. Meanwhile, in the hospital, Honda visits Shizuka and brings a laptop with him, so he can watch the Duel online and tell her how her brother is doing. The Duel does not start off very well for Jonouchi, as he is intimidated by Roba\u0026rsquo;s psychic powers. Yugi is watching the Duel from a rooftop and sees Roba\u0026rsquo;s brothers spying on Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s cards, revealing that Roba is actually cheating. Yugi decides to just watch and let the Duel take its course. Eventually, Jonouchi figures that he is being watched from somewhere above them. Roba\u0026rsquo;s brothers realize they\u0026rsquo;re busted for sure. Yugi congratulates Jonouchi on his efforts as he is now in control of the Duel. Mokuba finds out about the cheating, dashes in and tackles the wicked accomplices up on the roof. He threatens to expel Roba from Battle City, but the brothers talk him out of it after telling him their story: they are orphans and have no one but Roba to protect and care for them. Mokuba, having been in a similar situation, is convinced to let the Duel continue as long as they stop cheating. His decision is also influenced from seeing Yugi watching the duel from a different roof during his conversation and thinking that Yugi would give them a second chance as well. He stands by to be sure they don\u0026rsquo;t start doing it again. Meanwhile Anzu, who can\u0026rsquo;t find Yugi or Jonouchi, is sitting in a bench in the park and ponders about the past of the other Yugi. Back in the hospital, Honda lies to Shizuka about the Duel, saying that Jonouchi is winning when in fact, he is not. When a nurse comes in to examine Shizuka, Honda leaves the room and decides to call Anzu, who is now with with Sugoroku at the park. Honda asks Anzu to send a message to Jonouchi. He then returns to Shizuka\u0026rsquo;s room, who now knows the real status of the duel: she asked the nurse to look at the laptop and tell her what was going on while Honda was out. Honda apologizes for lying to Shizuka and the two start cheering for Jonouchi. The duel is reaching its conclusion. Jonouchi doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too good, but Anzu and Sugoroku arrive and tell him that Honda called from the hospital to say that he and Shizuka are watching the duel online. Anzu says they all believe in him, encouraging Jonouchi to fight on, which gives him enough motivation to win the duel. Esper Roba is acting like a sore loser, worried about his brothers, but just then the Roba brothers arrive and they tell him how proud they are of him for doing his best and almost winning, even without cheating. Esper stands up and gives his brothers a hug, then he hands over his \u0026ldquo;Psycho Shocker\u0026rdquo; and Puzzle Card to Jonouchi and promises he will not cheat again. Jonouchi accepts it and walks off with Anzu and Sugoroku. Episode 69 - Black Magic of the Soul\rA duelist, Koji Nagumo, was unhappy with the card he won through the ante rule after one of his Duels. He was demanding that his opponent also gave him his second rarest card. At that moment Mokuba and Kaiba show up. Kaiba gives him a briefcase of rare cards, challenges him saying that he should increase his deck\u0026rsquo;s power with those cards, and defeats him (offscreen) with the power of his God Card. Marik now knows where the god Obelisk is after Kaiba used it. He remembers how he stole the other two Egyptian God cards in Egypt and threatened Ishizu for the final one. He figures that the whole tournament was most likely planned by her, and that he should be wary of her machinations. After encouraging him in his next duels, Anzu and Sugoroku split up from Jonouchi and go searching for Yugi once again. Yugi is told to enter a circus tent by a harlequin whose \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; is wating inside. Anzu and Sugoroku manage to see him in the distance and follow him, but lose track when he enters that place. Yugi then enters a real life Mystic Box and disappears into an underground chamber, which blocks the transmission of his Duel Disk to the Kaiba Corporation building. There, he meets Pandora, a Rare Hunter who also has a \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo; in his deck. He challenges Yugi to a duel. Both Duelists have their ankles locked so they cannot escape. As they lose life points, a buzzsaw will approach them and slice off their legs if they lose. A box holding a key will open for the winner. In the meantime, Mokuba (who was tasked by Kaiba to investigate Yugi\u0026rsquo;s dissapearance from the grid) meet up with Anzu and Sugoroku. During the duel Yugi summons \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician Girl\u0026rdquo; for the first time, turning the tables and beating his opponent with the power of the magicians. Pandora tries to use a hidden key to break himself out. However, Marik plays tricks on his mind using his Millennium Rod so he cannot see or feel the key he already has on his hand. Yugi breaks himself and manages to free Pandora out of his locks, saving his legs. Marik speaks to Yugi through Pandora and tells him of how he was the one who controlled Keith, and of his own motives and plans. He is part of a family of Tomb Keepers who has been protecting the legacy of the pharaoh for 3000 years, isolated from the rest of the world. Marik is the heir to that clan, and wants to become \u0026ldquo;new Pharaoh\u0026rdquo; himself by collecting all three god cards. He wants to be freed from that terrible destiny and put an end to the tradition of his clan due to the suffering and pain they have endured for generations. And to do that, he must kill \u0026ldquo;the other Yugi\u0026rdquo; and collect all three god cards. Just afterwards, Anzu, Sugoroku, Mokuba and Honda (who bumped into them a few moments ago) find Yugi. Episode 70 - The Trap of Revenge - Rampage! Parasite\rIt\u0026rsquo;s the morning of the second day of Battle City. At Yugi\u0026rsquo;s house, Anzu and Honda arrive and meet Sugoroku but he tells them that Yugi has already gone to the city. Anzu blames Honda for being late. Meanwhile, Jonouchi bumps into Mai and Yugi in the main square. Mai has already 4 puzzle cards and Yugi has 3, so Jonouchi is feeling a bit behind with only 2. Jonouchi then goes searching for another opponent. At one point he is just standing around when he is addressed by a kid who wants his autograph. The kid asks him to hold his Duel Disk and runs away when Jonouchi is distracted bragging. Jonouchi chases him, but the kid is stopped by Honda, who was with Anzu and Sugoroku and had noticed the chase. The four of them question the kid, and he confesses he wanted to become a strong Duelist, but all of his cards were stolen. When pressed for a description of the thief, he describes Insector Haga, and Jonouchi immediately runs off to find Haga for a little payback. Once everyone is gone, the kid smirks and sneaks off to an alley. Haga is waiting there, and the kid reports that he did everything as planned. Meanwhile, a kid helps Shizuka watch the duel in the hospital by narrating everything that happens from the laptop. In a different place, Ryuzaki is bitter that he lost too quickly and would try to requalify by beating some duelist by betting cards, but would then find out it was useless as the system already rejected him, making him drop entirely from the tournament. Still searching, Jonouchi catches sight of Haga and challenges him to a duel. Both of them have two puzzle cards, and they wager both of them on the Duel. It becomes clear right away that Haga hasn\u0026rsquo;t lost his taste for Insect-swarming strategies, but Jonouchi puts up a good fight. At one point Haga manages to summon \u0026ldquo;Parasite Paracide\u0026rdquo; from Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Deck, and this is met with disgust and consternation from Jonouchi and the others, as Jonouchi doesn\u0026rsquo;t keep any Insect-Type monsters in his deck. They quickly realize that the kid from earlier put the parasite card in Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Deck under Haga\u0026rsquo;s orders when he briefly took Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Duel Disk. The situation gets worse when Haga makes it clear that he is planning to Summon an ace monster to surpass the \u0026ldquo;Great Moth\u0026rdquo; he Summoned in Duelist Kingdom. In the end, Jonouchi manages to find a way out of the insect\u0026rsquo;s trap using his \u0026ldquo;Gearfried\u0026rdquo; card and wins the duel, giving another step towards his goal of becoming a \u0026ldquo;True Duelist\u0026rdquo;. Episode 71 - Sky Dragon of Osiris\rThe Quiet One, a mime completely controlled by Marik and devoid of personality, runs around the city until he finds Yugi near the river, challenging him to a duel. By using a powerful combo, he puts Yugi in a really tight situation which gets even worse when he summons his God Card: The Sky Dragon of Osiris. Meanwhile, his friends are waiting for Jonouchi to pick an opponent. He is decided on keep challenging only stronger opponents than him so he can grow and become a true duelist. At that point Kaiba shows up, confused about why is Jonouchi dueling in his tournament. Jonouchi recklessly challenges him and he accepts, but at that moment a Kaiba Corporation helicopter shows up, telling Kaiba that the second God Card has appeared. Kaiba leaves, telling Jonouchi that he was lucky this time. The god card seems invincible and Yugi is on the brink of defeat. Kaiba shows up to watch the duel between Yugi and his Ghoul opponent, and demands that he stand up after seeing him drop to his knees. In the end, Yugi manages to find the out and pulls off an incredible move to turn the tides and win the duel in an unexpected way. With his victory, he now is the owner of Osiris. Kaiba then demands a duel to see who gets to keep Osiris, but Marik briefly regains control of the Quiet One to tell Yugi that he is on his way to Battle City and that he is now going to target Yugi\u0026rsquo;s own friends to turn them into his mind slaves and get what he wants. Yugi calls off his duel with Kaiba for the moment, so he can find his friends before Marik. Episode 72 - The Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk\rYugi is in a rush searching for his friends, and Kaiba decides to help him on the promise that Yugi will duel him after they make sure they\u0026rsquo;re safe. They are then stopped by two Rare Hunters who challenge them to a tag duel in which Kaiba displays the oppressive power of his God Card Obelisk for an overwhelming win. Meanwhile, Jonouchi and his friends encounter Bakura on the streets and go to the aquarium where they find Kajiki. Bakura splits from them and meet Marik, after being alerted of his presence due to his Millennium Ring. Marik gets off his bike and the two of them initially test each other\u0026rsquo;s Millennium powers. They then make a deal to work together to achieve their respective goals: Bakura will help Marik get the God Cards in exchange for his Millennium Rod. Episode 73 - The Legendary Fisherman\rBack at the aquarium, Jonouchi and Kajiki duel each other in a back and forth duel that concludes in Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s victory. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to take the \u0026ldquo;Legendary Fisherman\u0026rdquo; card that means so much to Kajiki, but he insists, telling him that he earned it and that he needs to give up that card to be able to grow independently. Jonouchi now has 6 puzzle cards and has virtually qualified to the finals. After that, Shizuka calls Jonouchi and congratulates him. She says that she\u0026rsquo;ll soon be able to take off the bandages and that the first thing she wants to see is him dueling. Honda departs to bring her there. As he leaves, they see a man asking for help while holding an injured Bakura. The man introduces himself as Namu (but in reality is Marik) and says that he found it like this in the street. Sugoroku takes Bakura to the hospital. A group of Rare Hunters surrounds Anzu, Jonouchi and Namu and beat them up, taking them hostages. Episode 74 - The Mask\u0026rsquo;s Curse - High-Rise Duel\rMokuba goes back to the heartquarters to search for Jonouchi given that Kaiba and Yugi couldn\u0026rsquo;t find them in the Aquarium. On his way there, Mokuba is captured by some Ghouls. The Masked Duelists show up and challenge Yugi and Kaiba to a tag duel of great risk on top of a skyscraper, while mocking Kaiba after they kidnapped Mokuba. In that duel, when a player\u0026rsquo;s LP reach 0, the glass floor under him will break, plunging that duelist to his death. Kaiba and Yugi fail at first to work with synergy and make mistakes that almost cost them the duel, but eventually they get to actually work together. As the duel is taking place, Mokuba manages to escape captivity with the help of Anzu, who asks for him to get help. Meanwhile Rishid steps on to where Jonouchi is being held tied to a chair and extends his hand towards him. Marik, who is behind Jonouchi completely unseen, takes control of his mind with his Millennium Rod, making it look like Rishid was the one to do it. Afterwards they repeat this process with Anzu. As Kaiba and Yugi defeat one of the Masked Duelists and they win the duel, Marik takes control of the other one and reveals that he has managed to completely brainwash both Jonouchi and Anzu with the power of his Millennium Rod, and that he\u0026rsquo;ll be waiting to see them soon. Kaiba takes the final puzzle cards from the defeated so both Yugi and him have 6 now. A helicopter from Kaiba Corporation shows up to pick them up, and Kaiba receives a call from his brother who tells them what happened with him. Mokuba tells them to meet him in Domino\u0026rsquo;s Port, the location where Yugi\u0026rsquo;s friends are being held hostage. Episode 75 - Heartless Duel - Yugi vs. Jonouchi\rThere are duels happening all over Domino City as the tournament progress. Shizuka and Honda are on the train going to the city. Meanwhile, in the helicopter, Kaiba and Yugi are talking about Marik and the Millennium Items. While Kaiba refuses to believe in that \u0026ldquo;occult nonsense\u0026rdquo; (even though he has experienced the power of Pegasus\u0026rsquo; and Ishizu\u0026rsquo;s items before). The Other Yugi then tells him about himself, about how his true identity is the soul of a Pharaoh trapped in the Millennium Puzzle. Kaiba is surprised by this revelation and recalls his conversation with Ishizu. Rishid has acquired 12 puzzle cards on his own as requested by Marik, for the next stage of their plan. Then, Rishid gives Jonouchi some new powerful and banned cards to add to his deck. Yugi and Kaiba reach the port and are greeted by the mind-controlled Jonouchi, who guides them to their dueling platform. The mind-controlled Anzu also shows up and toss Mokuba towards them, a bit beaten up. She defeated him in a duel moments before they arrived, after finding his hiding spot. Anzu then straps herself to a special metal chair and explains the rules of the duel: Yugi and Jonouchi will be chained to an anchor that hangs above the dueling site. When a player\u0026rsquo;s Life Points reach 0, his opponent\u0026rsquo;s key will be unlocked, allowing him to remove the chains. The loser is dragged into the sea forever. If the 40-minute time limit expires, the anchor is released anyway, and both duelists are drowned. Kaiba and Mokuba try to stop the duel but Marik reveal the final part of his plan: if anyone attempts to stop the Duel, a Rare Hunter controlling a crane will drop a shipping container on top of Anzu, killing her in an instant. Marik then forces Yugi to cast aside Osiris, keeping it from being lost in the water and also preventing him to use it. Osiris wasn\u0026rsquo;t in Yugi\u0026rsquo;s deck as he had no intention of using it during the duel as it was too dangerous, but he takes the opportunity to include Red-Eyes in his deck. As the rules have been explained, Marik releases Anzu from his mind-control to make her watch the duel too. She is surprised about what is happening and asks Kaiba to stop it, but he can\u0026rsquo;t do it or her life will be at risk. At the same time these events occur, Marik learns of Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s sister, Shizuka arriving in Domino City, so he instructs Rishid and his Rare Hunters to go capture her. The two friends then duel eachother. Jonouchi uses his powerful and banned cards to take an immediate advantage. At one point, Yugi takes over The Other Yugi during the duel, much to Marik\u0026rsquo;s anger (he wants to see the Pharaoh suffer, not his vessel). As he is reminded of his former self, Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s consciousness begins to shake from Marik\u0026rsquo;s control. He refuses to take \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes Black Dragon\u0026rdquo; by the effect of \u0026ldquo;Exchange\u0026rdquo;, remembering that he promised to become a worthy duelist before taking back \u0026ldquo;Red-Eyes\u0026rdquo;. Yugi reminds Jonouchi of his promises to himself, to the Other Yugi, and to Shizuka. Meanwhile, Honda and Shizuka escape from the Rare Hunters with the help of Otogi. They bump into Mai who was on a car and she drives them away. They go to the Port after getting the information from the Rare Hunters, in where they see the conclusion of the duel. Jonouchi has finally managed to break free from Marik\u0026rsquo;s control due to the power of his bond with Yugi, but there is barely any time left. Yugi, not wanting to see Jonouchi die, decides to lose the match on purpose. Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s key box opens. But Jonouchi is unwilling to let his friend sacrifice himself this way, so he uses the same effect to force the duel to end in a draw. Yugi\u0026rsquo;s key box also opens, but he is barely conscious due to the banned card\u0026rsquo;s direct attacking effects which have taken a toll on his body. Jonouchi jumps over the platform to save him just as the time ticks down and the anchor drops. Shizuka takes off her bandage and the first thing she sees is his brother in a duel, jumping and trying to save a friend. She dives into the harbor with Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s key to free him after Jonouchi frees Yugi with the latter\u0026rsquo;s key. At the same time, Kaiba knocks out the Rare Hunter operating the crane by throwing a card at him, and uses a remote control to ram his helicopter into the hanging crate, knocking it away from Anzu. After the Duel, the Other Yugi\u0026rsquo;s spirit is invisibly standing behind Yugi and the gang, thinking to himself that Yugi has taught him a lesson about the power of friendship and that Yugi will one day surpass him. Episode 76 - Shadow of a Duel\rAfter Marik\u0026rsquo;s attempt to defeat Yugi by mind-controlling his friends backfired, he sets his sights on defeating the Pharaoh at the Battle City Finals. He has implanted a part of himself in Bakura, and once in there Marik convinces the evil Bakura to also enter the Battle City Finals. The evil Bakura takes over his vessel and stands up. He is in the hospital and Sugoroku is with him. He knocks Sugoroku out using the power of his ring and leaves the place. He steals a Duel Disk and puzzle card from a random duelist and heads to a graveyard, following a rumor that there were Duels being held there. He finds Kotsuzuka, Takaido and Satake dressed in halloween costumes, terrorizing random duelists in order to obtain puzzle cards without even dueling. Even though they\u0026rsquo;d already obtained five cards this way, Bakura is not impressed and challenges the three of them to a duel in the Shadow Realm. Not knowing any better, they accept. By losing the duel, all three are sent to hell. Bakura obtains his sixth Puzzle Card, qualifying for the Battle City finals. Meanwhile, Yugi and Jonouchi have both qualified for the Battle City Finals by having 6 puzzle cards each. By putting the Puzzle Cards on the Duel Disk they receive instructions to go to an unfinished stadium which would be the location of the finals. Episode 77 - Battle Ship Takes Off!\rThe group are close to the location of the finals when they are stopped by a hollywood star: Jean-Claude Magnum, who declares his love for Mai and after recall a previous duel ends up dueling her once again, saying that if he wins they will marry, and she says that if she wins he will leave her alone once and for all. He has five puzzle cards, so he has apparently proven himself in this Battle City tournament. She, however, defeats him with ease. But unwilling to take a \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; for an answer, he has a stuntman and tries to kidnap her, but it fails and Jonouchi saves her from a big fall. The group then goes to the place for the finals, Domino Stadium, a place under construction where Kaiba is waiting for them. Magnum, defeated, decides to forget about her and dueling in general and leaves the place, leaving his duel disk behind. A masked female figure picks up the disk shortly after and takes the five puzzle cards out of it, adding another that she had in her pocket. After Yugi, Jonouchi and Mai arrive to the arena and are qualified for the finals, Marik arrives too under the disguise of Namu. Jonouchi is a bit suspicious about his true motives, and Marik notices it so he briefly take control of Anzu\u0026rsquo;s mind to divert the attention. Jonouchi eventually dismiss his suspicious. Bakura (still injured) arrives and announces he is also a finalist, baffling everyone. Rishid comes in at this point, identifying himself as Marik, another finalist, which drives strong reactions from Yugi, Kaiba and Jonouchi. Mokuba introduces the airship (a blimp) where the finals will take place. The airship lands and all the contestants enter, although Yugi\u0026rsquo;s friends are initially not allowed as they are not finalists but Mokuba persuades Kaiba to let them on. Kaiba orders the airship to leave, even though the last finalist has not arrived, and his staff is unsure about what to do, but at the very last moment Ishizu Ishtar arrives as the 8th duelist. The finalists spend time alone in their designated rooms, except for Jonouchi who is with Shizuka and later Honda, Anzu and Otogi, who do not have their own rooms. Yugi plans his deck while talking to the Other Yugi, and says that he is worried about two things: Bakura (they agree that Bakura is most-likely once again under the influence of the Millennium Ring) and the 8th duelist (that no one knows who is it). Then, the finalists are called to the main hall to decide who will duel first that night. Episode 78 - First Duel in the Sky - Yugi vs. Bakura\rYugi (number 3) and Bakura (number 6) are randomly selected as the first two Duelists and the Aerial Dueling Arena is revealed to be the location of the quarterfinals. The other passengers and duelists watch on the sidelines. Yugi suspects that Bakura is actually the evil Bakura and once they reach the arena he demands that he reveal himself, which Bakura does so accordingly. They duel in the sky in a really back and forth battle that has Bakura corner Yugi with his powerful spell and trap cards, and it ends up with Yugi finally summoning Osiris to turn the tides. At the last moment, Bakura is about to lose but Rishid steps up in his disguise of Marik and claims that he is actually in control of Bakura. The other personality of Bakura is confused, but the real Marik tells him to release Bakura, as it is the only way for him to win. The Other Bakura does so and the normal Bakura takes over the duel. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where he is and is still injured so he drops to his knees. He asks Yugi for help but Yugi will be disqualified if he approaches him. Yugi\u0026rsquo;s only options are to surrender the duel to help Bakura, or attack with Osiris which could do further harm his opponent. At the last moment The Other Bakura decides he cannot risk Bakura dying or being seriously harmed because he needs Bakura as a host to stay alive, so he takes over from Bakura and lets Yugi win the duel. After the duel ends, the Other Bakura lets Bakura take over again, and he is taken to his room completely unconscious. The group leave to ask Kaiba to land the airship so they can take Bakura to the hospital, and Anzu says she will stay there to look after Bakura in the meantime. At that point, Marik takes control of Anzu and takes away the Millennium Ring from him. Episode 79 - Hidden Power - Mystery of the God Cards\rYugi and his friends ask Kaiba to land the airship so they can take Bakura to a hospital. Kaiba refuses, but he calls a medical team to take care of Bakura on the ship. Honda leaves to look for the missing Millennium Ring on the dueling platform, dragging Otogi along. Up there they get into a bit of a fight over Shizuka, and they trip and almost fall over but are saved by Shadi. Moments later, in Yugi\u0026rsquo;s room, while adjusting his Deck, he notices Shadi\u0026rsquo;s reflection in the window. Shadi apologizes for their last encounter, saying that he had to be sure that Yugi had the strength to face what will be coming next. Yugi tells Shadi that he knows the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle is really the spirit of the Pharaoh. Shadi confirms this, and tells Yugi that all seven of the Millennium Items are onboard the ship along with all three Egyptian God cards and that the conditions are right to unlock the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s memory. But warns him that the items and the god cards can only be used by those chosen to wield them. He then tells him about Pegasus\u0026rsquo; journey to Egypt. Pegasus was trying to find a way to bring back his lover to life, and ended up discovering carvings of monsters, including the Egyptian Gods thanks to Shadi\u0026rsquo;s help, which later became the inspiration for the game Duel Monsters. However, following his discovery and launching card production, Pegasus learned that nearly everyone involved with the production of the God Cards had begun to die under mysterious circumstances. Among them was a photographer who fell from the window of his hotel\u0026rsquo;s room after seeing an apparition of Obelisk, having incurred the wrath of the Gods themselves. The rest of his team was too afraid to continue working on the project. Pegasus refused to stop making the cards, deciding to take onto the task himself as a challenge to the Gods. On the night after he finished painting the cards\u0026rsquo; design, his Millennium Eye showed him a vision of ancient Egypt in his sleep, where the world was being destroyed by the Gods he had painted. At this point, Shadi appeared to Pegasus. He told him the monsters were real and that Pegasus could not control both the darkness and the Gods at the same time; the solution was to seal the God Cards back in Egypt for they were too powerful. Pegasus, having experienced the Gods\u0026rsquo; power himself, took the completed cards and gave them to Ishizu Ishtar to be sealed. Back in the present, the Other Yugi shows up and Shadi drops to one knee in a sign of respect, telling him that all he needs to do to awaken his memory is to win the tournament. He then vanish as the participants are being called for the second match of the finals. Shadi then briefly goes to Ishizu\u0026rsquo;s room. She was thinking about his brother being a happy young boy, and tells Shadi that a horrible fate is awaiting Marik and that she joined the tournament to stop it. He tells her that the duty of the Tomb Keepers is coming to an end, one way or another. She asks him if he would relinquish his items to the Pharaoh, as he will need them to fulfil his fate, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer and just vanish again. Finally, Shadi appears invisible behind Anzu in Bakura\u0026rsquo;s room and sees her with the Millennium Ring in her hands. He stares with anger towards the unconscious Bakura and then vanish one last time, leaving the airship. Episode 80 - The Winged Divine Dragon of Ra\rThrough random selection, the next duel will have Jonouchi (number 2) face off against Rishid (number 7) whom everybody still believes is Marik. Before the duel begins, Rishid shows off his Millennium Rod to help keep up his disguise (but it is actually just a replica of the original). As the duel progress, Rishid displays excellent dueling and controls the pace with ease. At one point, Jonouchi almost forfeits but a talk from Mai and Shizuka boost his confidence. Later, Rishid draws the egyptian god card to his own shock and confusion. Marik had slipped it in his deck to help him pretend that he is actually himself. Marik instructs Rishid to play the card but he fears that the card is too powerful and that he is not worthy enough of it. He tells him that is actually just one of many fake copies made by the Rare Hunters. The Rare Hunters could not use them because they had no connection to the ancient scriptures, but Marik believes Rishid will be able to. Rishid decides he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to use the card to win. During a flashback we learn about Rishid being abandoned as an infant in Egypt and taken in by a woman. As a child, Rishid found out from his adoptive father, Mr. Ishtar, that the family needed an heir to carry on the legacy of the Tomb Keepers. Mrs. Ishtar suggested Rishid, but Mr. Ishtar insisted it could only be their biological child; however, he reluctantly agreed when Mrs. Ishtar stated that it was fate that brought Rishid to them. When Ishizu was born, Mr. Ishtar was disappointed she was a girl and he wanted to try again for a boy. Mrs. Ishtar suggested to Rishid that he become the Tomb Keeper. Rishid was pleased about this because he would then truly be part of the Ishtar family. Later on, Marik was born and he replaced Rishid as the heir. Mrs. Ishtar died shortly after giving birth. When Marik was a child, he became ill after he was bitten by a cobra. Mr. Ishtar was furious and blamed Rishid, but Marik still loved Rishid as his brother. Shortly before his Tomb Keeper\u0026rsquo;s initiation, Marik was upset that he would have to live underground his whole life. Rishid offered to take Marik\u0026rsquo;s place but Mr. Ishtar refused. After Marik\u0026rsquo;s initiation, where he was marked with the scriptures, Rishid marked his own face to prove his loyalty. Rishid also noticed a change in Marik\u0026rsquo;s behaviour after that date. Back in the duel, Jonouchi announces that he believes Rishid isn\u0026rsquo;t really Marik since Rishid is dueling fairly while Marik has always been sneaky and manipulative. Yugi agrees and starts being suspicious of the other participants: it could be Namu, or it could be the 8th duelist. Kaiba is surprised by this declaration but doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe it, he must be Marik. Although Rishid is about to win, Marik tells him to instead use The God Card, as it is his last chance to convince everyone he is the real Marik. He convinces him by saying that by playing it he will truly be a part of the Ishtar family. Rishid summons the counterfeit god card, but the real god becomes enraged and creates a thunderstorm. Rishid feels like a failure and is struck by lightning. His fake Millennium Rod shatters, confirming to Yugi he isn\u0026rsquo;t really Marik. Jonouchi is also struck by lightning. Since both duelists are unconscious with the same amount of Life Points, Kaiba declares that the winner will be the first one to get back on his feet. Jonouchi has a dream where all his friends give him encouragement. This helps him stand up and win the duel. Rishid tells Jonouchi who the real Marik is and falls unconscious. Namu (Marik) confirms this against his will, as the Evil Marik takes over his body. Episode 81 - Awakening of Evil\rThe group is in Rishid\u0026rsquo;s room, and he is unconscious. They still don\u0026rsquo;t know his name. Before the next duel is decided, Jonouchi brings up the dream he had about all his friends when he was knocked out in his duel against Rishid. Mai asks him if she was in this dream but out of embarrassment, he lies and says she was not. Mai interprets this as Jonouchi not caring about her, and steels her heart about dueling and friendship. Yugi takes a few minutes and goes to the room of the 8th duelist, speaking through the door and saying that he knows her identity. Ishizu lets him in. Yugi explains that Shadi showed up before the duel and mentioned that all the Millennium Items are in the ship, therefore he guessed she was the last one. She confirms it, and asks him what does he know about Shadi. They talk for a bit and she reveals what happened in the Museum just a few days ago, and her encounter with the evil Bakura. She tells him that Bakura took Pegasus\u0026rsquo; eye back in Duelist Kingdom, and also tells him that Shadi is actually dead, much to Yugi\u0026rsquo;s surprise. At that point the announcer says that the next duel is about to be defined. Yugi leaves to go there, but Ishizu refuses to go with him, simply saying that she knows she\u0026rsquo;ll duel in the last duel, and that she needs to remain hidden until then. The next duel is Mai (number 4) against Marik (number 5) who is now his evil persona. Marik, who brainwashed a doctor to get the key to Rishid\u0026rsquo;s room, is about to kill him when he hears his name called out to the duel, so he leaves for now to deal with that and later deal with Rishid. The duel is an evil spectacle in which Mai displays amazing skill but is overpowered by how wicked Marik is. He turns the duel into a Shadow Game: when a monster is destroyed its owner will lose pieces of their memory. She starts losing memory of her friends. Marik loses memories of their underlings but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care. Mai is tortured by this experience. Yugi tries to help her using his Millennium Puzzle and interfering with the Shadow Game, angering Marik and encouraging her to win. She turns things around with great skill. At one point she even steals his God Card and summons it but is unable to control it due to not knowing the special chant. He takes controls of it and unlocks its sealed form. She is then chained by some monsters and cannot move. Jonouchi climbs to the stage to free her, and although she does not remember him, he is able to make her remember him by telling her the truth about his own vision after being struck by Ra. The god attacks them, but Yugi jumps and takes the blast. He gets knocked out but he just saved their lives. Mai thus loses the duel and Marik sends her to hell with the power of his Millennium Rod. Her mind becomes trapped in a giant hourglass where she will slowly forget all her friends. Episode 82 - A Duel with Destiny\rThe group is standing in Mai\u0026rsquo;s room and she is unconscious. There is nothing they can do as she has lost a Shadow Game. Shizuka stays with her and the rest go to see the final duel between Kaiba (number 1) and Ishizu (number 8). She arrives to the arena and reveals who she is, also stating that she is Marik\u0026rsquo;s sister. Kaiba then reveals to everyone that it was her who was originally behind this whole tournament, and that she gave him Obelisk. Ishizu mentions that she originally said that Kaiba will return that card to her, and this duel will be the moment he does that. Ishizu and Kaiba duel, and although he seems to have the initial advantage, she is unfazed and completely outplays him thanks to the power of her Millennium Tauk. When Ishizu has him cornered and nearly out decked, it seems that her vision will come true and that Kaiba will be defeated. Suddenly Kaiba receives a vision of his own from the Millennium Rod that Marik holds, much to his surprise too. Kaiba ends up making an inexplicable move and sacrifices his God to summon his Blue-Eyes. This is the first time that Kaiba sees Ishizu surprised by the duel, and he takes it as an indication that his move was correct. He attacks and wins, thwarting fate itself. Ishizu, surprised and defeated, is also hopeful because just as he changed his own future, she now has the hope that the future in which she saw her brother suffering forever can also be changed. Episode 83 - The Tomb-Keeper\u0026rsquo;s Secret\rAfter Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s Duel with Ishizu, Mokuba leads him to where the script of Ra is being translated. Kaiba is startled to realize that he somehow understands the hieratic text and can read the words on his own. He falls to his knee, overwhelmed, wondering what is happening to him. The announcer declare through the airship speakers that the final duels of the tournament will take place the following day in the third and final arena. Elsewhere on the ship, Yugi and the others go to see Mai out of worry, where they are joined by Ishizu. Yugi questions her as to why Marik wants him dead and Ishizu agrees to tell them the whole story of her family. The Ishtars are the guardians of the Millennium Items and live underground in secret, away from everyone else. The secret of the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s memory is carried over from generation to generation, carved into the back of the succeeding male in ceremony (a fate which in this generation fell on Marik\u0026rsquo;s shoulders). One year after Marik\u0026rsquo;s ceremony, he planned with Ishizu and Rishid to sneak outside after their father went to bed. Ishizu reluctantly agreed after Rishid said he will help if anything went wrong, but she said that it will only be for an hour in the following morning. Marik was ecstatic. Early the next morning, after having put a pillow in Marik\u0026rsquo;s bed to make it seem like he was still sleeping, Ishizu and Marik slip out into the rising sun with Rishid. Marik was overwhelmed and fascinated by the outside world, the people and everything they found. On a nearby television set (which he has never seen before) he saw a man on a motorcycle drive off. Ishizu quickly dragged Marik off and reminded him that it was time to get back to the family. Marik begged Ishizu to let him keep a picture of the motorcycle. Ishizu, realizing there\u0026rsquo;s nothing she can do to dissuade him, told him to never let their father find out. They run into Shadi who was just standing in the middle of the street and who tells them the Pharaoh is about to revive and that a fate of bloodshed and tragedy awaits. He also said that the tragedy is the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s will. He then disappears, telling Marik to find the Pharaoh. After searching and failing to find Shadi again, Ishizu tells Marik to forget all he saw that day. Upon their return, Marik points out a device that acts as an alarm to tell of someone leaving the tomb. In the darkness, they had previously missed it. Ishizu runs off in panic for Rishid. They find Rishid being whipped by their father. Mr. Ishtar tries to hit Marik, but his evil persona emerges and catches the whip as it nears him. Releasing the whip, Marik takes the Millennium Rod and binds his father and Ishizu to the walls with magic, the latter of whom falls unconscious. Marik proceeds to stab his father to death with the Millennium Rod\u0026rsquo;s hidden blade. He is about to do the same to Ishizu, but Rishid regains consciousness and the Evil Marik is suppressed by the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik again. Marik is completely unaware of what he did. Upon seeing his father\u0026rsquo;s body, he begins to panic. Shadi then appears above the body and says that it was the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s revival that led to that fate. The Other Yugi realizes that his own revival is what led to the torment Marik is going through. Jonouchi, however, refuses to forgive Marik for what he has done to Mai and the rest of them, no matter what his reasons are. Ishizu states that they are the only ones who can save Marik from the darkness. Yugi asks her about the God Cards and he tells him what she knows, on how she met Pegasus and they had a small duel using the power of their Millennium Items that ended in a draw, which gave Pegasus the confidence to give her the cards for safekeeping. As she tells them this, Anzu and Honda recall what they saw back in Duelist Kingdom, that vision of Pegasus in ancient egyptian robes dueling some gravekeeper. They thought it was a dream, but they are now convinced it was real. At this point there is a call for lights out on the ship and everyone prepares to depart. Anzu and Shizuka will stay in Mai\u0026rsquo;s room while Honda and Otogi will stay at Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s room. Jonouchi reminds Yugi of their promise to duel each other again. Shizuka jokes that Jonouchi should ask Ishizu to see if they will duel in the final, to which Ishizu states that, since her battle with Kaiba, she can no longer see the future. She then gives Yugi the Millennium Tauk, stating that Yugi still needs the other five Millennium Items and the three Egyptian God cards to awaken the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s memories. She also says that they originally belonged to Yugi and that now her job as a Tomb Keeper is complete. Anzu chases after Ishizu, asking what will happen to the Other Yugi when the seven Millennium Items are returned to the tomb in Egypt. Ishizu simply replies that every soul has a place to return to. Anzu is then taken control of and returns the Millennium Ring to Bakura, who wakes up instantly. In Yugi\u0026rsquo;s room, he and the Other Yugi talk of what will happen when all the items are returned, with Yugi saying that it\u0026rsquo;s his duty as his vessel to help him recover his memories (and shedding a tear when his back is turned). In Rishid\u0026rsquo;s room, Marik is about to kill him, but is distracted by Bakura revealing himself. Bakura states that the original Marik is with him. After a quick battle with their respective Millennium Items, they agree to play a Shadow Game for the items, with the only rule being that the loser will disappear. Episode 84 - Showdown in the Shadows\rMost of the group is asleep after a really long day. Jonouchi is having a nightmare about losing Mai. Kaiba is still analyzing \u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo; and looking for ways to defeat him. At the aerial arena, the evil Marik is about to duel against Bakura and the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik in a Shadow Game. Before the duel starts, Marik confronts his evil self and reveals that he has learned (through Anzu) about what really happened back then after Ishizu told the group. He now knows that it was him who actually killed his father. He reveals that he thought that the man that showed up that day (Shadi) was actually the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s soul and that he was the one who had killed his father. His whole anger towards the Pharaoh started there. He declares that both he and his evil self will pay for what they did to his father, and they will be destroyed together. In his own thoughts, Bakura deduces that the turban-wearing man that Marik is talking about is Shadi, but also knows that five years ago he was already dead. So he\u0026rsquo;s been acting as a ghost ever since. Meanwhile, Yugi is dreaming and his Millennium Puzzle activate, allowing him to actually go to his other self Mind Room and talk to him there. During this Shadow Game as their life point decrease, they will lose a portion of their body. It\u0026rsquo;s a back and forth duel. At one point Bakura forces the God Card to Marik\u0026rsquo;s hand and then takes it via Exchange, however Mairk uses other card effects to stop it from gaining attack on summon. With no use for it, Bakura tributes it. He believes to this to a safe move, because even if Marik were to revive \u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo;, it would have 0 ATK and DEF. However this backfires as \u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo; had an ability not even the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik Ishtar knew about. Anzu wakes up, confused about being in Bakura\u0026rsquo;s room and not finding him there. She also was sure that she was in Mai\u0026rsquo;s room just moments ago so she is not sure how she got there. She goes to Yugi\u0026rsquo;s room and wakes him up. They go searching for Bakura. Eventually they take the elevator and find out about the duel that is taking place in the arena. Due to his greater connection with the Millennium Rod, the evil Marik knew about the Point-to-Point Transfer effect. He proceeds to revive \u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo; and use this effect to win the Duel, causing Bakura to be consumed by the shadows. As he disappears, Bakura vows to resurrect and kill Marik, identifying as the darkness itself. Marik then takes the Millennium Ring to himself. The regular Marik takes control of Anzu and makes her leave the arena quickly. Ishizu wakes up from a nightmare in which she saw her brother engulfed in flames. Anzu (actually Marik) gets to her room and speaks with her, asking her to hide Rishid to protect him from his evil self. Meanwhile the portion of Bakura sealed in the Millennium Puzzle wakes up and thinks about his next move. He will wait for now until the Millennium Items are gathered and, in the meantime, will search for the \u0026ldquo;Door of Truth\u0026rdquo; that lies somewhere within the Millennium Puzzle maze. Evil Marik returns to Rishid\u0026rsquo;s room but he is not there. In the meantime Kaiba has analyzed everything he could about Ra and is worried about his powers. Episode 85 - The Land of the Decisive Battle, Alcatraz\rThe following morning the airship arrives to Alcatraz, an island that belongs to Kaiba Corporation and was the headquarters of a previous military installments of the company before Seto took charge. Atop the wreckage stands the Duel Tower, the third and last battlefield for the Battle City finals. Marik confronts Ishizu about the location of Rishid, and threatens her with his Millennium Rod after realizing she no longer has her Millennium Tauk to protect herself. But as they arrive to the island he says that sadly he does not have the time to brainwash her and extract the information about Rishid. As he leaves, Marik says that because Rishid was struck by the anger of Ra is probably that he won\u0026rsquo;t ever wake up again anyways. Laughing, he assures her that he will take his time killing Rishid after the duels are done. Jonouchi goes to see Mai but her condition hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed. The group reunites with Yugi who was still looking for Bakura but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find him. The group then leave the airship and goes towards the Duel Tower. They need to decide the order for the semi-finals, and for that they will hold a four-way free-for-all duel. As each player\u0026rsquo;s Life Points decrease, their chair in the Duel Tower rises up. When a player\u0026rsquo;s LP reach 0 their chair will rise all the way to the top, to the setting for the Semi-Final round. The first two duelists to lose will face each other in the first Semi-Final. The two winners will face each other in the second Semi-Final. This allows each duelist to influence who he will face next by deciding to attack who at what time. Back in the airship, Shizuka remembers how she met Mai and the words she gave her about her brother. Ishizu meanwhile ponders in the room where she hid Rishid, remembering how it all started and wishing for Rishid to wake up as things got terribly wrong when he lost conciousness. She also remembers how the day after Marik killed their father, he and Rishid left the place. That day she put on the Millennium Tauk for the very first time and saw the future, a very similar future to the one they were now experiencing. Some time after that, Marik stole the two egyptian gods but she confronted him when he tried to get Obelisk from a vault. He defeated her military guards using his Millennium Rod and she defeated his Ghouls using her Millennium Tauk, ending in a stalemate. He escaped with the help of Rishid. From that point onwards their destiny would lead to where they are now. Back at the tower, Kaiba wants to duel Yugi so that, when he wins, he will have two Egyptian God Cards, as he knows he will need all the power he can get to stand up against The Winged Dragon of Ra. Yugi at first cannot decide who he wishes to face due to having reasons to fight everyone: Kaiba to settle their rivalry, Marik to defeat him and save his memories and Jonouchi, to keep his promise about dueling him in the finals, so he decides to wait and see what they will do. Jonouchi wants to duel Marik so he can win back Mai\u0026rsquo;s soul and claim revenge for her capture. Marik doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care who he faces or when, so he just plans to have fun wreaking as much havoc in this duel as possible. The duel is tense and rapidly changing, with strange alliances at every turn. In the end, Yugi and Kaiba rise as the winners and both Jonouchi and Marik will be the first two to duel in the first semifinal. Episode 86 - The Darkness Returns\rThe first semi-final duel between Jonouchi and Marik is about to begin on the top of the Duel Tower. Honda calls Shizuka and tells her, but she says that she\u0026rsquo;ll stay with Mai and believe in her brother. As the match begins, Marik initiates a Shadow Game with upped stakes. Dark energy strings connect the duelists to each monster they summon. As a monster is destroyed or weakened, a corresponding amount of \u0026ldquo;damage\u0026rdquo; is dealt to the monster\u0026rsquo;s owner. Anzu tells the Other Yugi about something that Jonouchi told her, that he wants to rescue Mai himself with his own strength and he is willing to end up in the same condition as her if that brings her back: he will do whatever it takes. As the duel progresses Marik is surprised by how strong Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s willpower is to sustain the damage of the Shadow Game. Jonouchi plays amazingly and surprises everyone present. The duel end up in a really back and forth fight that forces Marik\u0026rsquo;s hand to even unleash the final secret ability of Ra: God Phoenix. In the end, Shizuka feels that she needs to go there, and after Ishizu offers herself to look after Mai, Shizuka reaches the top of the tower just in time for the final part of the duel. Even facing the strongest Egyptian God in a Shadow Game, Jonouchi manages to somehow withstand the god\u0026rsquo;s attack and stay on his feet, barely conscious. Marik is terrified at this, realizing that he will lose if Jonouchi manages to summon a monster. With the last of his power Jonouchi draws and tries to summon his monster to make the final attack and win, but when he summons it the last bit of strength abandons him. The exhaustion and pain takes its toll and he plummets to the ground. Mokuba rush to the platform and checks on him, only to realize that he is not breathing. Due to him not being able to continue, Marik wins by default. The group rush to him, trying to resucitate him. Marik is terrified of what just almost happened, but after a few moments he smiles and starts laughing. The medical team arrive and take Jonouchi to the ship. Despite losing a Shadow Game, Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s mind is battling the shadows and resisting being banished to hell like Mai. He nonetheless remains unconscious and is taken away for medical attention. After examination, Jonouchi is in critical condition and they all feel desperate. Yugi walks out the room and punches the wall in anger and frustration. Suddenly, the Millennium Tauk on his pocket shines and he sees a vision of the future, a vision of him and Jonouchi dueling in Battle City. He is then summoned to the second semi-final, so he goes to see Jonouchi once again and tells him that Jonouchi must keep fighting as a duelist so that they can duel again. Anzu runs after Yugi and tries to stop him, stating this tournament has been too dangerous and he should not duel. The Other Yugi (convinced that he must duel so the vision comes true) reminds her of the egyptian slab in the museum they saw together, and says that even though his life should have been gone a long time ago he is there now, alive, looking to find what has been lost. He tells her that he is convinced Jonouchi will be back, that as long as people have a reason to search for answers they will have a reason to live, a place to return. He will fight as a True Duelist to make his promise to Jonouchi a reality. Episode 87 - Clash in the Coliseum\rThe second semi-final duel between Yugi and Kaiba begins. They duel in a field of an ancient Roman coliseum. They summon their powerful Egyptian Gods and clash with each other in an insane duel of skill and mindgames. At one point, an attack from Osiris that misses hits the skyline causing lightning bolts to shoot down from the sky. This reactivates the power levels of Seto\u0026rsquo;s blimp, allowing Mokuba to call a helicopter for Jonouchi and activating the broadcast of the Duel on Battle City\u0026rsquo;s giant screens. Meanwhile, Jonouchi is having visions of the past, of how he fought his very first tournament: the District Duel Tournament before Duelist Kingdom. But the visions are a bit different, he hears some voices, and he has his current deck. Somehow, in his mind, Jonouchi is fighting to come back to life. At the Sky Duel Coliseum, the fated duel and the clash of the gods ends up in a gigantic explosion when the two gods defeat eachother at the same time. A bright light emerges, destroying the giant tv screens of the city and blinding everyone on the island. Marik\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Rod starts to glow in response, just like Yugi\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle. The light transports the souls of Yugi and Kaiba back to ancient Egypt. In a destroyed ancient egypt, a giant pyramid can be seen upside-down in the sky. Everything is in ruins. Statues of Osiris and Obelisk can be seen in the distance. Then the scenery changes and they get transported inside the royal palace where they witness a duel between what seems to be their own previous lives. The priest that looks like Seto claims that \u0026ldquo;the High Priest of Darkness has conquered Heaven and Earth with his evil power, and that even his Millennium Items were worthless against the power of darkness\u0026rdquo;. The Pharaoh asks why has he submitted to them. The priest replies that he and his faithful servant shall forever be his enemy. They wield the Puzzle and the Rod against each other. The priest claims that he will defeat him with his own hands and summons his powerful servant: the White Dragon. The Pharaoh summons his powerful servant: the Black Magician. They shout \u0026ldquo;Diaha!\u0026rdquo; as their powers clash in a duel. Yugi and Kaiba are transported back to the present as the light fades and the Rod and Puzzle stop shining. They are still in disbelief of what they just saw. Marik is confused as to why his Rod activated itself and what they saw after that. The Other Yugi is sure that the vision was a part of his past, even if Kaiba refuses to believe it. They continue their duel using his other monsters and are back again at full intensity. Near the end, Yugi feels the presence of Jonouchi and turns around Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s attack by summoning Red-Eyes. At this moment, Jonouchi wakes up, to everyone\u0026rsquo;s relief. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand why Mai is still in that state because he is sure that he defeated Marik, but then Shizuka explains what actually happened to him. Jonouchi apologizes to Mai and tries to go see Yugi\u0026rsquo;s duel despite the doctor objections, specially now that the helicopter with medical help has arrived. He insists on going, even after Anzu tries to convince him, and tells her about the promise he made to Yugi, which makes her remember Yugi\u0026rsquo;s final words before his duel. She then agrees and they all run to see the match. At the top of the tower, the duel continues and reaches its climax. Kaiba puts up a fantastic final attack but Yugi then comes up with an even better final strategy and ends the duel in fantastic fashion, finally defeating Kaiba and declaring that the anger and hatred that Kaiba feels would never lead him to true victory. Episode 88 - The Path towards a True Duelist\rAfter a really intense couple of duels, the finalist of the Battle City tournament are decided: Yugi vs Marik. The final duel will begin shortly. Kaiba, in desbelief after losing at his own tournament and refusing to accept the words that Yugi give him about his friends giving him enough strength to win, tosses Obelisk to Yugi and walks away in a huff. But then, Jonouchi stands in his way and challenges him to a duel for the third place. Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s ideology that a True Duelist doesn\u0026rsquo;t need the power of a friend, clashes with Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s words. He accepts the duel and they both go to ground level to fight. Anzu gets mind-controlled again and leaves as the duel starts. She encounters Ishizu and reveals that the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik has been hiding inside her mind since the previous night. They talk about the Ishtar family and everything that happened so far. In the end, the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik says that he will take care of his evil personality and asks Ishizu to take care of Rishid, as Anzu starts running towards the Duel Tower. Marik is standing on top of the Duel Tower, still thinking about the vision that the Millennium Rod and Puzzle gave to Yugi and Kaiba. He is pissed that the Rod is not replicating the vision for him, even though he is the owner of the Item, and tosses it to the ground. The Millennium Rod ends up at the feet of Anzu, who has just arrived and picks it up. Marik tries to grab the Rod but Anzu uses its powers to push him aside and reveal that it is indeed the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik taking control of her. The duel continues and Kaiba has the advantage but Jonouchi puts up a good fight. At this point the Millennium Puzzle react to what is happening with Marik, and Yugi sees a glimpse of Anzu\u0026rsquo;s face. Worried about her he runs towards the Duel Tower too. On top of the Duel Tower, Anzu has Marik\u0026rsquo;s cornered and is threatening him with her Millennium Rod, pushing him to the very edge of the platform. The evil Marik manages to distract his other self by talking about Rishid and takes the opportunity to grab Anzu\u0026rsquo;s arm and pull her, taking the Rod from her and turning the tables on the situation. Now Anzu is the one pushed to the edge, but she makes an acrobatic move and frees herself from it, dodging Marik\u0026rsquo;s attack. She later receives a full force energy blast of the Millennium Rod, pushing her to the ground. Just as Marik is about to kill her, Ishizu shows up. The power of the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Marik has weakened by now and Anzu pass out. The evil Marik now attempts to kill Ishizu but Yugi shows up, stopping him with the power of his Millennium Puzzle. They are about to clash with magic, but Marik leaves the place instead, saying they will solve everything in the duel. Anzu is still passed out from Marik\u0026rsquo;s mind control. Ishizu tells Yugi that her brother is growing weak and he will continue growing weak until he is no more. She tells him that he can destroy the evil within Marik\u0026rsquo;s dark side by defeating him in his next Duel but if Yugi loses it would be the end of everything. She begs him to save her brother. The Other Yugi feels responsible because the Tomb Keepers had been guarding the Items and protecting his own memories for so long, so he promises that he will defeat his dark half and save him from the dark curse. Just then Anzu finally regains consciousness and awakes, Yugi immediately notice and rushes over to her. She had no idea why she was up at the tower, with the last thing she remembers was watching Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Duel with Kaiba. Yugi wonders why would Marik go after Anzu. Back at the third-place duel, in the end, the experienced duelist proves to be too strong and even if Jonouchi makes some impressive moves, Kaiba ends up winning. Yugi, Anzu and Ishizu arrive but the duel has already ended. Kaiba, having nothing that matters to him anymore decides to leave the island and detonate it, though Ishizu catches up to him and tries to convince him to watch the final Duel as well as help Yugi beat Marik. She then talks about the stone tablet and how it has written in it a prayer for the dead in Hieratic writing known as the \u0026ldquo;pert kertu\u0026rdquo;, a message that the Priest inscribed to \u0026ldquo;his true friend\u0026rdquo;, the late Pharaoh: \u0026ldquo;The corpse sinks to the floor. The vessel becomes sand, becomes dust. Even the brightest gold, even the sharpest sword is wrapped in the sheath of time. Woe to the Pharaoh, for his body lacks even his name. Time is a battlefield of souls. I cry the song of battle, the song of a friend. To the place far away where souls meet\u0026hellip; guide me.\u0026rdquo; Kaiba asks what does she means with it and she says that just as the Priest and the Pharaoh in the tablet were rivals they were also friends. And this is the time for him to help Yugi aswell. Kaiba refuses to do anything as the only point of his tournament was so that could be the #1 Duelist again, but because of his loss against Yugi, that\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible, so his only option now is to destroy the island. Mokuba remembers what Yugi and Jonouchi said about his brother in their Duels against him, that hater and anger wont lead him to the right path, and that he should have fun in the duels. Mokuba states to Seto that destroying the island won\u0026rsquo;t do any good for anyone, including themselves. Due to this and remembering on how his brother was in the past compared to now, Mokuba reveals that he really wants to see his brother as he used to be, smiling and enjoying games from the bottom of his heart. Instead of causing more damage, Kaiba should try and help Yugi beat Marik since Kaiba did figure out a way to beat \u0026ldquo;Ra\u0026rdquo; and was planning on using it against Marik before he lost. Kaiba is left conflicted, but he ultimately decides to do so. As the final Duel begins, Kaiba gives Yugi the card he planned to use to defeat Yami Marik. Episode 89 - The Final Face Off\rThe final duel begins. Its a Shadow Game played between the Other Yugi and the evil Marik: as each player\u0026rsquo;s Life Points decrease, their respective hosts (Yugi Muto and Marik Ishtar) will have more and more of their body wiped out. When a player loses, both spirit and host will be sent to hell. However, Marik would not be sent to hell along with his \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; spirit if he loses, since he is an alter ego that Marik created himself, whereas the Other Yugi is a completely different spirit living dependably inside Yugi\u0026rsquo;s body with Yugi\u0026rsquo;s own spirit. The duels begins strong, and they quickly manage to summon the Gods to face each other. During the duel Marik also reveals that it was him who defeated Bakura, and shows the Millennium Ring as proof. At one point, Yugi places his trust in destiny and, with his eyes closed, draws and sets a card without even looking at it. They are all surprised at this, and Kaiba looks around and sees Ishizu staring at him, which makes him realize that somehow the card just played was probably the one he gave Yugi. And it was. Using that card Yugi manages to protect himself from Marik\u0026rsquo;s insane one-turn-kill attack and keep fighting. The spirit of the normal Marik shows up in the airship near Rishid\u0026rsquo;s bed to say goodbye and apologize as he feels that he is going to disappear soon. Back in the duel, Dark Marik\u0026rsquo;s strategy continues to evolve and he manages to gain the upper hand once again with his powerful God Slime. Then, normal Marik takes control of Anzu in front of everyone and speaks with Yugi, saying that there is no need to hold back and that he is prepared to die, explaining to the rest what is actually happening in the shadow game (they cannot see the other selfs of the duelist actually in combat). Marik pushes the Pharaoh to its limits, but he finds a way to turn the tables and properly defeat Ra against all odds. In addition to this, Rishid managed to wake up and slowly made his way to the battlegound, and by doing this, he helps Marik takes control of his own body once again, which changes Marik and the evil Marik\u0026rsquo;s position in the shadow game. The normal Marik now stands as Yugi\u0026rsquo;s opponent, and in his final move he surrenders by placing his hand on his deck, erasing his dark self forever and giving Yugi the victory. In the aftermath of the duel, Yugi becomes the champion of the tournament and is once again crowned Duel King. He also gets the last Egyptian God card as per the ante rule. On the other hand, Marik is freed from his evil self and reunites with his sister and with Rishid. Marik then gives the Pharaoh his Millennium Rod and Ring, and also the Millennium Eye that apparently Bakura had in his possession too. Then Marik shows him the carvings on his back as his final duty of a Tomb Keeper. Ishizu proceeds to read some of them out loud: \u0026ldquo;In the future, one will come who will wield the power of the three gods depicted on the stone slab. This will be proof that the Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s soul has been reincarnated.\u0026rdquo;. Yugi finds out he can read the symbols himself, and as he does he sees a brief vision of the stone slab. Kaiba announces that he will destroy Alcatraz in exactly one hour, and they all rush to the airship before the island explodes. Jonouchi goes to see Mai and is devastated that she is still in bed. But she was messing with him and she and Shizuka laugh about it. They later find Bakura in the kitchen, eating a bunch of food, without a worry in the world. The ship is about to depart but they cant find Seto or Mokuba anywhere. Just as they are leaving and the detonation starts, they hear Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s laugh and see that he and Mokuba emerge from the devastation in a Blue-Eyes-shaped jet. Mokuba and Kaiba depart, saying they are going to America to develop their new Kaiba Land over there and all over the world. Yugi realizes that Kaiba has started a journey towards his new dream and smiles about it, hoping that he would leave that hatred behind with the destroyed island. The group then starts their journey back to Domino City. Episode 90 - One for the Road\rBack in Domino City, Ishizu and Marik thank Yugi for helping defeat the evil persona. They will rebuild their family in a new direction, now that their generational duty has been fulfiled. Marik says that on the day Yugi visits Egypt he wishes to be his guide. Ishizu says that she will start the preparations for his arrival to the place they would need to go in Egypt, but that he first must find the rest of the Millennium Items. Yugi would need to somehow contact Shadi for the Key and the Scales (something easier said than done). The Ishtars then leave with Rishid to go back home. Otogi says that he will also leave to America to continue working closely with Industrial Illusions (specially after hearing what Kaiba said about Kaiba Land), and departs from them but not before sneakingly giving Shizuka his phone number. Honda yells at him for this but later says to take care. As they talk about their future, Honda grabs Shizuka\u0026rsquo;s hand and also gives her his phone number, so Jonouchi yells at him and they all laugh. Mai then announce that she is leaving as well. After Mai and Shizuka exchange words of thanks between them, she tells Yugi she won\u0026rsquo;t lose to him again before departing. As she turns around and leaves in a hurry, Jonouchi catches her as she\u0026rsquo;s getting on the car. She says that their friendship was a little too bright for her, but they depart on good terms and smiling. As she leaves and is out of their sight, her face turns somber as she thinks about everything that happened to her. The city is fascinated by what just happened and the news of the tournament extend like wildfire. The internet is also being flooded with images and videos of it and its protagonists. The following morning, at sunrise, Yugi has finished a new deck and grabs the Red-Eyes Black Dragon card. He arrives to the designated area and encounters Jonouchi waiting for him. It\u0026rsquo;s time for the final duel, the promise of their Battle City clash as the sun rises behind Jonouchi.

Overall, this whole Museum arc was also a good chance to focus on the side characters for a bit and plant some seeds for upcoming future plots.\nChapters\rSetting\rTimeline\rDuels\rCharacters\r← Previous Arc The Millennium Chapter Next Arc → List of Episodes\r41\r42\r43\r44\r45\r46\r47\r48\r49\r50\r51\r52\r53\r54\r55\r56\r57\r58\r59\r60\r61\r62\r63\r64\r65\rEpisode 41 - Memories of the Kingdom\rIn Pegasus Castle, Yugi and his friends are reunited with Bakura and Mokuba. Mr. Crocketts apologizes for Pegasus being absent, and gives Yugi a card called \u0026ldquo;The Ties of Friendship\u0026rdquo; as proof of his championship title, along with the check for the prize, which Yugi gives to Jonouchi. Outside the castle the gang meet up with Kaiba, who is grateful to see his little brother Mokuba, but warns Yugi they will duel sooner or later. He then leaves toward his helicopter and the guys follow him asking if he can give them a ride to the city, something Mokuba happily agrees. Mai also joins them on the helicopter since she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have another way out of the island. While flying home, they talk and start to rememorate duels from the tournament and how they got to the island. Jonouchi asks Mai about her first opponents and she briefly mentions the ones she defeated to get 8 stars as boring and uninteresting, with the exception of Jonouchi himself. That said, after her loss to Panik she felt in debt to Yugi so she started really early the following morning, searching duelists all over the island. There were few duelists left, and she assumed a bunch of them had been defeated by the Player Killers that night. In a duel arena she found Kajiki and Ryuzaki dueling and decided to watch first and then duel the winner, since they were betting six star chips in total, 3 on each side (Ryuzaki had 3 chips after losing to Jonouchi). Yugi recalls that after he defeated Kajiki that first day Kajiki still had 1 star chip, so he definetely got one or two more wins after that to reach 3. Near the end of that duel, Mai saw three duelists on the beach below them finding some star chips on the sand and screaming in joy about it. Jonouchi and Yugi interrupt her with surprise, saying that those were definetely the star chips Mokuba stole and were thrown into the sea. Kaiba, who was just passively hearing from the front seat, asks Mokuba about that. He admits with regret of stealing the chips from that poor kid. Jonouchi ask Mai to describe those three duelist and when she does, they clearly associate them to the ones they met on the Graveyard Field. Mai saw how those three kept a Star Chip each (that\u0026rsquo;s all they found apparently) and went into a cave near the beach. She followed their tracks, dismissing the Ryuzaki and Kajiki duel for the moment, and once she reached the cave she challenged them. Satake and Takaido ignored her and kept going through the caves, stating that they knew of a shortcut to the castle and that they had business with someone (Anzu assumes they meant Keith for sure). Kotsuzuka guided her to the Graveyard field, and once in there he revealed that he hid another star chip from the others. Mai challenged him by betting all her 8 star chips for his 2, and defeated him. She then went ahead on the caves searching for the other two duelists and got lost. Halfway through her path she met Kajiki who was searching for her after defeating Ryuzaki. She agreed to duel him but only after they find the other two that fled, since she was thinking that defeating Kajiki and those two will net her with exactly 18 star chips to repay Yugi. They walked through the caves, with Kajiki talking about his father and his duel with Ryuzaki that was a revenge for the japanese tournament, and a bunch of other things that Mai didn’t really cared about. They finally got to the Labyrinth entrance, which they went through just in time to see the Meikyu brothers finishing Takaido and Satake in a duel. Mai teamed up with Kajiki to duel Mei and Kyu. The two brothers however refused to bet Star Chips. They said that to leave the cave they would need to beat them, but that the time limit for the classification round was near and that the Player Killers were tasked by Pegasus to stall for time since there were less star chips available for duelists at this point. Mai and Kajiki won that hard fought duel, but didn’t get extra star chips for it. They got out of the Labyrinth but the time was running out and there weren’t any more duelist around so the two of them decided to bet all their star chips together and see which would make it to the castle. Mai won the duel and gathered 16 star chips in total. She would then go on to meet the guys and the rest is known. Yugi and the others then talk about the finals. Bakura is shown quietly looking through the window. They all get to Domino Port in the middle of the night and part ways for now, with Kaiba declaring once again to Yugi that he will duel him at some point pretty soon. Episode 42 - The Big Five\rOn the following morning, inside Kaiba Corporation headquarters, the Kaiba brothers confront The Big Five for making an alliance with Pegasus and trying to take over their company. However, they manipulate Kaiba into trying his new virtual game, Duel Monsters Quest. All seven go into the virtual world using some special virtual pod machines, but in reality this is their plan B after Pegasus\u0026rsquo; defeat. In secret the Big Five planned to defeat Kaiba in the virtual world using cheats, and have arranged the machine to have the loser of the duel actually lose their mind in the virtual world. By doing that, they would be able to take the company keys that the brothers hold and become the majority shareholder themselves. The virtual world looks real and is brilliantly made. Suddenly, the Big Five change the environment and challenge Kaiba and Mokuba to a duel. They will be using the Boss Rules for team duels, which means that they would collectively share a board and have their turn iterate with the Kaiba brothers. Even after they stacked their deck to have the perfect initial hand and summoned \u0026ldquo;Five God Dragon\u0026rdquo;, a legendary Fusion monster, Kaiba takes the initiative and with the crucial help of his brother manages to overcome them and win. The brothers leave the virtual world. Kaiba, unaware of what just happened to the minds of the Big Five and just seeing all of them unresponsive in their virtual simulator pods, orders his men to remove them from his presence. Episode 43 - The Girl from America\rThe day after returning to the city, Yugi goes to the hospital to see his grandfather and hugs him as he is conscious now, his mother is there aswell. Sugoroku is excited about the Egyptian Exhibition that is said to be coming soon to the city (he watched the news about that on the hospital TV early that day) and wants to get in contact with a friend of his, professor Yoshimori. Sugoroku is released from the hospital. Yugi and his friends take him home, where they find an American girl waiting for them. She introduces herself as Rebecca, a twelve-year-old prodigy Duelist who is accusing Sugoroku of stealing her \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo;. She demands it back, but the gang and Sugoroku have a problem with this as Seto ripped it up in the first episode. Rebecca challenges Sugoroku to a Duel for it, but since he just got out of the hospital, Yugi (and not his other-self) takes his place. They duel at the new arena in Kaiba Land. During the Duel, Sugoroku notices Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s Deck and strategy are very similar to an old friend of his named Arthur Hopkins. Rebecca reveals herself to be Arthur\u0026rsquo;s granddaughter, and continues to accuse him of theft. Sugoroku tells the story of how he met Arthur. It was at an archaeological dig in Egypt years ago. Arthur was reading some Egyptian hieroglyphs and noticed they resemble Duel Monsters, making him believe that ancient Egyptians used these monsters in battle for power and control. Unfortunately, no one believed him, but he never gave up on his research. One day, Sugoroku and Arthur were in a tomb when the roof caved in, trapping the two men. There was only enough water for one person, so they decide to duel for it. In the end, Sugoroku decided to surrender, even though he could have won, because he knew Arthur would need the water more than him. He notices the Duel between Rebecca and Yugi is going in the exact same way as the Duel he had back then. In the end, Yugi does surrender. Rebecca demands her \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo; card back. Sugoroku reluctantly shows the card to Rebecca, which has been taped together. Rebecca rages out of control upon seeing this as she thinks Sugoroku tore it up. Sugoroku tries to tell Rebecca he would never do such a thing, but Rebecca again won\u0026rsquo;t listen to him. At this point, Arthur arrives and tells Rebecca to behave herself. Arthur shows Rebecca the top card of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s Deck, which was \u0026ldquo;Soul Release\u0026rdquo;, and that it would have allowed Yugi to win the duel. Rebecca is shocked upon finding out about this, but she asks why did Yugi forfeit when he had the chance to win. Arthur explains that Yugi deliberately forfeited to teach Rebecca about the Heart of the Cards and that there is more to life than winning. Rebecca apologizes and to prove their friendship, Yugi gives her the \u0026ldquo;The Ties of Friendship\u0026rdquo; card. Sugoroku talks a bit with his friend, asking him why is he there and Arthur explains that he’s in the city to see the egyptian exhibition on the museum that’s coming up in a few days. Arthur mention that he got the Blue-Eyes card originally from Pegasus, after he consulted with him in regards to Duel Monsters and egyptology design. He also forgives Sugoroku for what happened with the card. Episode 44 - The Mysterious Transfer Student – Ryuji Otogi\rBack in school we can see Anzu and Honda having a practice duel that Anzu wins. Honda is getting practice but he is still a total newcomer. Meanwhile Jonouchi is a bit jealous that a new student called Ryuji Otogi is attracting all the girls with dice tricks. Otogi gets Jonouchi involved with one of the tricks, and by playing off of Jonouchi’s gullibility, the trick works. Jonouchi gets angry and he challenges him to a duel. Otogi agrees but only if they duel by drafting new booster packs. They also make a bet, the loser will be the winner’s pet for a week. They go to Otogi’s game shop that has a Duel Arena. While getting there a small flashback is shown of Otogi discussing getting revenge against Yugi with an employee of his. He claims that Yugi only defeated Pegasus in Duelist Kingdom by cheating, and plans to expose him to the world. The game shop is full of people. Otogi says that he will broadcast the duel on the screens and they draft the cards. Jonouchi is confident with what he got. Then the duel begins, and after some back and forth Jonouchi makes some big misplays by not knowing or reading properly his cards and Otogi ends up taking the duel. Having won the bet, Otogi orders Jonouchi to put on a dog suit that he got him. Seeing his friend humiliated by Otogi, Yugi gets angry and challenges him to a duel. If he wins, Jonouchi will be released from the deal. Otogi agrees, but says that if he wins, Yugi will swear on his grandfather’s life that he will never play Duel Monsters again and give up his title of “King of Games”. Episode 45 - Showdown! The Dungeon Dice Field\rThe duel begins in a special field called “Dungeon Dice Field” that has some interesting rules that change how the regular duel monster game is played. Yugi has to learn on the go and struggles at first, but eventually is able to pull up a good combo and wins. During the duel Otogi tells him about how he is the actual inventor of the Dungeon Dice Field along with some other cards, that he started to collaborate with Industrial Illusions as a card designer and that he wanted to push his project forward. He had a contract with them and even met Pegasus himself, but after the Duelist Kingdom tournament was over Pegasus has dropped off the face of the earth. Therefore he had some grudge against Yugi, blaming him for what happened to Pegasus. After the duel, Otogi apologizes for how he treated them and they all end up in good terms. Moments later, his laptop signals a message. He opens the email, and with a thrill, he sees that Industrial Illusions has sent a production contract after all. NOTE: Instead of a Dungeon Dice Monster duel they will play a normal duel but with DDM terrain and rules, as a way to mix both ideas. The focus of this project is on Kingdom Duels so its best if we keep everything related to the rules we are creating.\nEpisode 46 - Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s Sister\rThe Egyptian Exhibition is about to begin in a few days and the Domino Museum staff is hard at work preparing for it. At school, Jonouchi is having a practice duel with Honda when Yugi tells them about the exhibition and that his grandpa can let them in on the premiere day thanks to him knowing a university professor who works there. They all decide to go (although Jonouchi is scared of mummies), but when he checks the date he says that he might not be able to go with them after all. Jonouchi tells them that he has received the prize money from Industrial Illusions and started the process of scheduling her sisters operation. Shizuka herself is coming to visit him on that very same day when the museum exhibition begins, so he don\u0026rsquo;t think he can go with them. Instead, they all agree to hang out with her instead, regardless of what Jonouchi wanted. A few days later they meet Shizuka at Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s place, in the morning, and Honda falls for her at first sight. Otogi joins them too this time, after being invited by Yugi and Anzu. They all go to spend the day together, a happy slice of life day. Shizuka is a kind soul and she is proud of her brother, and grateful of him giving her the chance of being able to cure her eyes. She is secretly worried about the operation, and although she says nothing, Anzu picks up on this and comforts her for a bit. At some point in the afternoon Yugi tells them that he is leaving to go with his grandpa to the museum for the opening of the exhibition, but they all decide to join him anyway, including Shizuka and Otogi. They arrive and meet Sugoroku waiting for them alongside two other men. They are greeted by professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku\u0026rsquo;s friend) and Kanekura (the curator of the museum), who stares at Yugi\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle for a bit but says nothing. They spend the rest of the day there, roaming around the museum while Yoshimori gives them the tour, explaining different egyptian concepts like for example the Weighting of the Feather and the judgment: The crimes that people made would be measured with a scale. There are a few important egyptian pieces that will be arriving in a few days, but Yoshimori says that there is also a really interesting collaboration that they are having that week with Kaiba Corporation and their virtual reality pods, that can transport one to a virtual recreation of ancient egypt so they can actually walk and explore that place. Interested in the experience, they all go into the pods and jump into the virtual world. They start wandering, surprised by how real everything feels, when suddenly something strange happens and the landscape changes as they fell in what seems like an endless digital pit of green numbers and grids. Outside the pods, in the real world, Yoshimori is worried because the equipment seems to be malfunctioning. Sugoroku attempts to free Yugi but Yoshimori stops him, saying that freeing them now could cause damage in their brains. He wonders how could this be happening. Episode 47 - A Virtual Nightmare\rThe group (Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Anzu, Otogi and Shizuka) were exploring an egyptian temple in a virtual reality pod in the museum when they got trapped inside. Arriving to a weird digital-looking place, they are unsure of what is happening, when suddenly a young kid with teal hair shows up in multiple screens in front of them. He presents himself as Noah, and says that they were all invited there as a suggestion of his allies: the Big Five, who show up in multiple screens aswell. They explain who they are, and what happened to them after their duel with Kaiba and Mokuba, when they got trapped in the virtual space forever. They want revenge against Kaiba and are using the oportunity of the virtual reality pods deployed in the museum to trap Yugi, in order to lure Kaiba in. At that point Noah speaks directly to the camera, and we see that Kaiba and Mokuba have their own computer screens hacked by this kid. Noah directly confronts Kaiba, challenging to go there and save his so-called enemy as he knows he is in debt to Yugi for defeating Pegasus. Noah then says to the group that he is stealing something from Kaiba for them to use while they are in the virtual world: his new and renovated duel disk that would allow them to have a duel pretty much anywhere. These virtual duel disks would be just a projection, but would still work like the real ones that Kaiba has been developing in secret. The Big Five then propose a challenge to Yugi and the rest of the group: a Duel Monsters battle within the virtual world. If they win they can get out, but if any of the gang loses a duel to one of The Big Five, the winner will gain control of their body and escape to the real world while the loser\u0026rsquo;s mind will be trapped in the virtual world. They have introduced a new set of rules where each duelist has a \u0026ldquo;Deck Master\u0026rdquo;, a special card that acts as a main monster for them. The Big Five make a simple demostration of the rules, explaining that if a Duelist\u0026rsquo;s Deck Master is destroyed then that would mean losing the duel in the spot. To put the odds in their favor, the Big Five declare that they will be dueling anyone currently present before them, not only the duelists, so this includes Honda, Anzu and Shizuka. Kaiba is pissed off and tries to hack his way into that server in order to cut off their plans, but Noah declares that it is futile and that the amount of redundancies are countless. He has been planning this for a long time. The group protests, specially Jonouchi in defense of his sister, but the Big Five just laugh and splits them all, sending each of them to a different location within the virtual world, as the transmission cuts off. Mokuba asks his brother what is he going to do. Kaiba orders Mokuba to stay there while he deals with it. Without wasting much time, he grabs something from a drawer, walks onto the virtual pods within Kaiba Corporation and go into the virtual world despite his brother\u0026rsquo;s protests. Mokuba, after seeing his brother jump in, decides to ignore his order and go in aswell. Episode 48 - Deck Master - Deepsea Warrior\rEveryone is dropped through virtual tunnels and ends up isolated in a different place of the virtual world: Yugi arrived to some sort of swamp, Kaiba ended up in a forest, Mokuba in a beach, Jonouchi in the outside of what seems to be a manor, Anzu in a canyon, Honda in a library, Otogi in a fancy hall, and Shizuka near a pond. Noah sends Oshita from the Big Five to challenge Yugi, but since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a body he takes the form of \u0026ldquo;Deepsea Warrior\u0026rdquo; which will serve as his Deck Master. Once there he challenges Yugi, who first needs to build his deck from a projection of virtual cards. Going through the cards, Yugi is about to choose Dark Magician as his Deck Master but Kuriboh emerges from the card on his own. He protests that he didn\u0026rsquo;t choose that card but Oshita declares that once chosen it cannot be changed, so Yugi decides to trust in Kuriboh who seems happy. They duel in the swamp, quickly getting used to the duel disks, and even as Oshita boasts his knowledge of philosophy and warfare to deplete Yugi\u0026rsquo;s reserves, in the end Yugi with the help of Kuriboh manages to win. When he does, a door shows up floating in the water. Meanwhile, Honda finds Otogi as they actually were in the same building. They try to get out but the hallways seem to be endless. On a different area, Anzu is being chased by some monsters and falls unconscious. Episode 49 - Duel on Ice - Anzu is Targeted\rAnzu wakes up in a cave, having been kidnapped by a group of Cyclops. She discovers they plan on cooking her, but she is rescued when a penguin drops a vine down a hole in the cave ceiling for her. After escaping, the Cyclops chase her over a wooden bridge, which collapses under their weight. The giants fall to their deaths while Anzu barely holds on. Meanwhile Honda and Otogi have managed to break free from that place by using axes and maces to destroy the hallway. They emerge outside where they find Shizuka running from a dangerous beast, and they manage to save her. Mokuba wanders in the beach and finds a working TV in the middle of the sand that is still on. It shows his brother walking through the forest. Suddenly a door shows up in front of Kaiba, who opens it and finds himself in a vivid picture of the orphanage that he and Mokuba used to live in. Anzu stands up and finds the penguin that saved her, who leads her to a raft which takes her to a beach filled with more penguins. One of them in particular can speak, and reveals to be Otaki, another of the Big Five, in the form of \u0026ldquo;Nightmare Penguin\u0026rdquo;. He challenges her to a duel in the icy environment, and when she rans away she ends up trapped in a block of ice surrounded by water. Anzu gets to build her deck and choose her deck master, and she picks Fire Sorcerer to be the one. As they duel in there, he seems to get the advantage and as he deals damage to her she starts to become encased in ice. Pulling her last strength, Anzu manages to turn around the duel in the end and win, marking a second victory over the Big Five members. Episode 50 - Gamble to Victory\rNoah is shown watching in multiple screens where everyone is. He lures Kaiba into the orphanage and displays a projection of his life there, while Mokuba watches on that TV in the sands. They watch the day that Kaiba challenged Gozaburo to a chess match and won. Gozaburo had agreed to adopt the brother if he lost. The scene changes and this time it is showing their life with Gozaburo. Kaiba was forced to overwork in his studies. When his toys were taken away, Mokuba saved his Duel Monsters cards and tried to cheer him up by sneaking them to him along with a drawing of a \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo; card. In the present day, Noah mocks the brothers. Meanwhile Yugi has found Anzu and they go through some door that appeared in the middle of the icy tundra. On a different area, Honda, Otogi and Shizuka walk through another of those doors and find themselves in a big hangar. Jonouchi has wandered around the manor for a long time and is getting angry. He bumps into a door and finds himself in a courtroom, with the next member of the Big Five waiting for him. It is Ooka, taking the form of \u0026ldquo;Judge Man\u0026rdquo;. Jonouchi builds his deck and picks \u0026ldquo;Flame Swordsman\u0026rdquo; as his Deck master. They duel and Jonouchi uses a lot of dice-related cards in order to try to push his advantage, but he keeps failing every coin toss. Yugi and Anzu manage to get there in the middle of the duel, and they cheer for their friend. Suddenly Noah actually appears and declare that the duel is invalid as Ooka has been cheating, he says that he will just eliminate Ooka but Jonouchi stops him and wins the duel despite the cheating. Episode 51 - A Man\u0026rsquo;s Path\rKaiba (and Mokuba) are still seeing the scenes from the past. Seto wonders who this kid actually is, why is he so obssessed with him and surpassing him, and who may be behind all of this, as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t think that Noah is capable of pulling a plan like this on his own. Honda and the other two find the next member of the Big Five waiting for them in the hangar they just appeared into. It is Ota in the form of his \u0026ldquo;Machine Sergeant\u0026rdquo; Deck Master. He plans to duel Shizuka, but Honda and Otogi (knowing her inexperience with dueling) negotiate with him and agree to a 3v1 duel. They build their decks and pick their respective Deck Masters (Raremetal Knight for Honda, Swift-Strike Black Ninja for Otogi and Goddess of the Mind\u0026rsquo;s Eye for Shizuka). During the duel she makes a lot of mistakes that Ota takes advantage of, and while Honda and Otogi try to cover for her it ends up leading to a really difficult decision. Making the ultimate move, Honda sacrifices his Deck Master to save her, but that means that he has lost the duel. The duel then continues in a 2v1. Devastated by this, Shizuka ends up gathering enough courage to get an advantage and, together with Otogi, avenge Honda by defeating Ota. As the duel was happening, Jonouchi, Yugi and Anzu had been walking through a cave looking for them. They finally manage to arrive and cheer Shizuka in her final turn. The duel ends with a bittersweet victory, because Honda has been defeated and thus has lost his body to the Big Five. Episode 52 - Settling the Score\rHonda\u0026rsquo;s mind has somehow found a way to a robot monkey card, and he has taken that form. His friends are now going through what seems to be a city when they encounter Kaiba. Suddenly, Ota in Honda\u0026rsquo;s body shows up and attacks Seto with a steel bar, but he is stopped by monkey-Honda. He escapes in a motorcycle and Seto pursues him in another one. Even though monkey-Honda cannot speak, Shizuka picks him up and convince the others to take him with them as he helped Kaiba. They try to follow Kaiba and find a pickup truck. At some point monkey-Honda flips a switch on his head that allows him to speak normally, but Jonouchi and Otogi dont trust him yet. Kaiba is stopped by Daimon on the road, crashing his motorbike, and the two of them begin a duel. Like his associates, Daimon is in the form of his Deck Master, but he has disguised it with clothes, a hat, and sunglasses. Kaiba does not attempt to learn his identity, and only when Leichter uses his ability to destroy Trap Cards, it is revealed to be \u0026ldquo;Jinzo\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile, Mokuba finds himself in an unfamiliar room. The TV in the sand disappeared and everything was replaced with what he sees now. Noah is in that room, they talk for a bit and they both watch Seto\u0026rsquo;s duel. During their duel, Daimon reveal how Kaiba managed to end up being who he is, and some of the things he did to become the chairman of Kaiba Corporation. Kaiba declares that he is going to purge the Big Five once and for all, and with a display of pure strength he pulls off the win. Episode 53 - A Deepening Mystery - Noah\u0026rsquo;s True Identity\rAfter Kaiba defeats Daimon, he runs off in search of Mokuba now that he knows he is there. Yugi and Anzu run after him while the rest of the gang are stuck behind with the pickup truck. Following the cries of a baby, they find themselves inside a manor a framed portait of Noah posing with Gozaburo. Another door takes them to a projection revealing that Noah is Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s son, and he originally planned to adopt Seto in order to motivate Noah in his studies. Yugi gives Kaiba the portrait of Noah and Gozaburo, who disregards the entire story as false because the photo was dated six years previously, but Noah has not aged since then. At Noah\u0026rsquo;s place, Mokuba tries to reason with him, believing that he is the son of Gozaburo and therefore like a brother to him. Noah is not interested in him that much, but Mokuba challenges him to a duel in order to make his feelings reach him. He is no match for Noah and is defeated, but Noah ends the duel with a pensive look on his face. Meanwhile, Oshita, Otaki, Ooka and Daimon chase the rest of the gang in an attempt to forcefully steal their bodies. Joey summons five monsters to stall them and they attempt to escape in the truck. After a harrowing chase, Noah rescues the gang from The Big Five since stealing their bodies by force is against his rules. Kaiba keeps going in search of Mokuba and Yugi and Anzu are reunited with the others shortly afterwards. Episode 54 - Big 5\u0026rsquo;s Counterattack\rNoah speaks with The Big Five. Ota is ready to leave the Virtual World in Honda\u0026rsquo;s body, but the rest are in danger of dismissal for their failures. They beg Noah for one more chance. Noah gives them their opportunity, and as their final chance for escape, the Big Five challenge Yugi and his friends, each one of them taking turns speaking through Honda\u0026rsquo;s body and bringing their Deck Masters in rotation. If Yugi and his friends win, they will give Honda\u0026rsquo;s body back. If the Big Five win they will keep all their bodies. They plan to take advantage of the inexperience of the others to be a burden to Yugi\u0026rsquo;s duelist capabilities. A massive duel begins and is going back and forth, but in the end a great combination of the gang manages to break the enemy and take the win, or so it seems. Meanwhile, Kaiba has reached Noah and demands for him to return Mokuba, who is nowhere to be seen. He then finds out about Noah\u0026rsquo;s funeral. Episode 55 - Defeat It! Five God Dragon\rAfter they lose, the Big Five cheat to stay alive and make an impossible field against yugi in a new duel, declaring that with him gone the rest would stand no chance later. Noah has detected this and teleports himself and Kaiba to the duel to stop them, but Kaiba is pissed off and stops him in his tracks. He joins the duel in Yugi\u0026rsquo;s team, suffering a intrusion penalty. Together, they face Five God Dragon and this time they destroy it for good by bringing Dragon Master Knight, a legendary combination of their strongest monsters. Noah permanently deletes the Big Five for cheaters after this, and Honda is left devastated thinking that he will never get his body back. Episode 56 - Noah vs. Seto - The Duel of Heaven and Earth\u0026rsquo;s Creation\rNoah teleports Kaiba and the rest to a volcanic area and the two of them start their most anticipated duel. At one point, Noah shows a sphere in the sky to Kaiba, revealing that it contains a digitized version of his brain and has kept him alive in virtual reality after he died in a car accident six years previously. Noah reveals that when his mind was digitized, he was able to rapidly gain knowledge from Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s computer database until he was more intelligent than any human. A flashback reveals that when Noah first existed in virtual reality, he was often visited by his father, who gave him a town to live in and people to interact with. Noah soon grew frustrated with the limitations of the world so he began to reprogram it. He told Gozaburo his idea of improving the virtual world by connecting it to networks around the real world. When he asked Gozaburo if he was capable of taking over Kaiba Corporation, Gozaburo refused to discuss it. Without Noah\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, he started to focus more on the newly adopted Seto and Mokuba. After a hard fought duel, Kaiba manages to find an opening and defeats Noah. Episode 57 - Darkness of the Kaiba Family\rNoah realizes that he\u0026rsquo;d lost because Seto has the courage to never give up, even when the situation seemed hopeless. Left alone in the Virtual World for six years after his accident, Noah felt that his father, Gozaburo, forgot him upon Seto\u0026rsquo;s arrival into the Kaiba family. Because of this, he blames his stepbrother for robbing him of his birthright of ownership of the family company, and he intended to take revenge by escaping to the real world. Moments later, Gozaburo Kaiba reveals his own virtual self to Noah and the gang and explains the story behind Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s adoption: initially, Kaiba was to become a replacement body for Noah\u0026rsquo;s digitized mind, but Gozaburo later determined that Seto\u0026rsquo;s mind was perfectly good and realized that even though Noah would have a body, his son would never truly grow up and would always remain a spoiled brat in spirit. Gozaburo turned his attention toward training Kaiba into becoming the businessman who would someday inherit Kaiba Corporation. Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s takeover of the company ruined Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s plans. Humiliated, he uploaded his own mind into Noah\u0026rsquo;s virtual world and was never seen in the real world again. As the mastermind behind the events drawing Kaiba and the gang to the virutal world, Gozaburo unveils his new plan: to trap everyone\u0026rsquo;s minds in the real world into Virtual Reality using the global networking idea that Noah had conceived six years previously. In being uploaded to the virtual world, the population of Earth would essentially become immortal, and Gozaburo would be the powerful ruler of the new world. Noah realizes for the first time that, although Gozaburo promised to help him claim his birthright when he uploaded his own mind to the virtual world, he was actually just using Noah and The Big Five all along. Noah leads everyone to a door which he claims is the exit. Instead of entering the real world, they each become trapped in their memories until they realize they\u0026rsquo;ve been tricked and return to a virtual Domino City. Noah teleports away and takes Mokuba to the virtual Domino City arcade where the real exit is. He takes possession of Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s body (given that he defeated him before) and escapes to the real world. Seeing right through Noah\u0026rsquo;s mind games, Kaiba heads through the streets of Gozaburo\u0026rsquo;s virtual Domino City for Kaiba Corporation and finds his biological father in the President\u0026rsquo;s office. He orders Gozaburo to shut down this virtual world and release everyone, but he replies that Seto must earn his freedom and challenges him to a duel. To remind his adoptive son of the painful moment he\u0026rsquo;d experienced when he dueled Yugi, who\u0026rsquo;d achieved the impossible by summoning Exodia in their first duel, Gozaburo reveals that he is using an Exodia Deck. Meanwhile Yugi and his friends are fighting an army of duel monsters. Noah has escaped to the real world in Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s body and moves towards Seto\u0026rsquo;s pod, planning to unplug it right and there to kill him. But he suddenly has a change of heart when he remembers the way Mokuba considered Noah his brother during their duel, despite the way he had been treated. Noah rushes back to try to help everyone escape, pointing to the location of the exit door, as the duel monsters keep spawning and start to become an insurmountable threat to the gang. The group manage to escape to the real world thanks to Noah, and luckily Honda wakes up in his real body. Kaiba wins his duel, and when Gozaburo turns into a red monster and tries to escape in Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s body by force, he activates a small device he has brought with him to this virtual world, one that starts to delete everything from the inside. Noah, in Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s body, climbs back inside the pod and reenters the virtual world. He returns his body back to Mokuba and the two say goodbye as Noah sends Mokuba back to the real world. Noah then traps Gozaburo, saving Seto, and as the place selfdestructs, Kaiba makes his escape. Episode 58 - The Man from Egypt\rBack at the museum the group gets out of the pods and find that Rebecca and her grandfather are also there. Sugoroku had called them in after the machines malfunctioned. Rebecca, a genius with computers, was able to eventually monitor them inside the virtual world and was trying to find a way for them to exit safely but they beat her to it. Professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku\u0026rsquo;s friend who works at the museum) ensures that the room is locked out from other visitors and states that they will need to get in contact with Kaiba Corporation to ensure it is safe before opening it to the public. Suddenly, Mokuba himself gets in contact with him on the phone and says that they will be taking the pods out of there for the time being. They all start talking about what happened in the virtual world with Rebecca and the others. After a while, Arthur explains that he actually came to the city to see this exhibition in the first place, to which Yoshimori replies that he considers it a great honor given that Arthur is a world renowned archaeologist, known for being the one who discovered a year ago what is rumoured to be Atlantis (a claim that is still in dispute, but impressive nonetheless). Yoshimori also mentions that Ms. Ishizu will be coming soon to the city with some really important pieces of the exhibition, and that they should not miss a second visit once she arrives. Meanwhile, Kanekura (the curator of the museum) is shown to be interested in the Millennium Puzzle and is watching them from afar with another man. The man thinks the Millennium Puzzle looks great and wants to buy it, Kanekura whispers to the man that they\u0026rsquo;ll do business in his office. A man (Shadi) is shown walking through the city, invisible and intangible. A bit of a flashback is shown from him, and an internal monolog about him seeing Pegasus in a coma on a hospital bed, with his Millennium Eye removed, and completely unresponsive. He regrets failing to find his attacker. He arrives at the museum and at the very same moment that group is walking outside, thanking Yoshimori for the visit and saying goodbye. Shadi (invisible to all) sees Yugi and his Millennium Puzzle in the distance and believes that\u0026rsquo;s fate that they have met there once again. But first he has something else to do. Kanekura is in his office when suddenly Shadi shows up and judges him with the Millennium Scale. They duel in a mind puzzle game, a Shadow Game, and Shadi finds him guilty of greed, evil thoughts and attempting to cash on egyptian relics, the judgment is death. Episode 59 - Desperate Situation!\rThe following day after school, on the TV, Sugoroku and Yugi hear about reporters on the museum talking about the curator\u0026rsquo;s death. They say it was apparently a heart attack but people are already talking about an egyptian curse. Sugoroku wants to go see Yoshimori at the University since this must be hard for him, but he can\u0026rsquo;t close his store just yet because he is waiting an important delivery of games, so he asks Yugi if he can go see him now that the school is over. He says that he will join him later as soon as he can receive the delivery. Sugoroku calls Yoshimori to let him know in advance. Yugi leaves the store and bumps into Anzu and Jonouchi who have just heard the news of Kanekura\u0026rsquo;s death. Jonouchi is certain this is a curse and wants to go with them to see Yoshimori since the Professor was nice to them the other day and they are all worried about him. They quickly call Honda but he is stuck at school with club activities so he apologizes he can’t be there. Meanwhile Shadi shows up to Yoshimori at his office and uses his Millennium Key (also known as Millennium Ankh) to look into his mind before judging him with the Scales. In his mind he sees that his heart is cluttered with obsessions from the past and that he neglected his family for his job. He also briefly sees Yoshimori’s brother dying by falling out of a window. The darkness of the room represents the anxiety and fear of death given the recent events, but he also sees hope. That hope is represented by Sugoroku and the group going there. Shadi is once again surprised to see Yugi present and decides that before killing this man he will use him to properly test Yugi, as he will face harder challenges in the future, specially from the one who stole the millennium eye and is still on the loose. Shadi redecorates Yoshimori\u0026rsquo;s soul room, turning him into a zombie. Yugi, Jonouchi and Anzu get to the University and meet with Yoshimori but he starts attacking them. Yugi is surprised to see Shadi appear in the professor’s office but he seems to be the only one who can see him. When it looks like Jonouchi is overpowering Yoshimori, Shadi brainwash Anzu and makes her go running to the roof. Yugi runs after her but cant catch her. When he gets to the roof she is already on the trap Shadi made for her, so they both duel in their minds with the power of their millennium items, while still being aware of their surroundings in the real world. Meanwhile Jonouchi escapes through a window from the demented professor and climbs up, where he sees Anzu. He tries to save her and they do it when Yugi defeats Shadi and the ankh clears Anzu mind. The professor climbed through the window after Jonouchi but the boy places the Ankh upon him and he is too released from the soul\u0026rsquo;s redecoration, coming back to himself. Defeated, Shadi leaves and mutters to himself that he is now sure without a doubt not only that Yugi is the proper holder of the Millennium Puzzle, but that he is stronger than what he initially thought. They all go back to the professor\u0026rsquo;s office and after being sure that he is okay they go to the university\u0026rsquo;s cafeteria to buy something to eat or drink, while the professor stays on his office resting for a bit from the crazy incident. Taking advantage that Yugi and his friends are temporarily absent, Shadi appears once again and tells Yoshimori that he still needs to be judged, rising the scales upon him. Sugoroku is walking down the street, finally getting to the University building when there is a sound of glass shattering. He sees his friend Yoshimori falling through the window and screams in horror. Shadi looks to the professor in the ground one last time and leaves, disappearing in the air. The silhouette of a young girl is shown in the door behind where Shadi just was, covering her mouth in horror after seeing what just happened there. Episode 60 - The Pharaoh’s Lost Memories\rThe group visit Yoshimori at the hospital and meet his wife, young son and niece. The niece, who is the same girl that saw what Shadi did to his uncle, and goes by the name of Fizdis, stares at Yugi\u0026rsquo;s millennium puzzle but says nothing. Yoshimori is out of danger but he is in a coma and he may never wake up. While leaving, Yugi wonders why Shadi\u0026rsquo;s method are so drastic and is unsure if its friend or foe, convinced that it was him who attacked Yoshimori when they were absent. A couple of days later Ishizu arrives to the city and starts making the final preparations for her egyptian exhibition. Shortly after she gives a press conference on TV about the museum, while also briefly mentioning the unfortunate events that occured there recently. She hopes for the best recovery for the professor and also encourage people to come visit, as its a one-in-a-lifetime experience to see all these relics for the first time. Yugi is shown walking on the streets. Anzu sees and calls him but he doesnt hear her. She stumbles upon a store with tv screens that is transmitting Ishizu\u0026rsquo;s conference, and is interested in her. Mokuba is also watching the conference in his place too, and mentions it to Seto, who doesnt care. At that very moment Ishizu herself personally calls Seto on the phone and invites him to meet with her at the Museum, with the promise of finding some rare cards. Kaiba and Ishizu meet at the Museum at night and she shows him an interesting tablet which surprises him. Ishizu uses the powers of her Millennium Necklace (also known as Millennium Tauk) to show him a vision of the past, of Ancient Egypt and of a battle between a priest and a servant of the Pharaoh. She then talks about the Ghouls and the God Cards, explaining what they are and what’s her true goal in the city. She gives Kaiba “The Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk” and instructs him on creating a tournament so that the other two Egyptian Gods can be found. She also states she will entrust Kaiba with \u0026ldquo;Obelisk\u0026rdquo; for the tournament but that he will give it to her back. When he asks why would she trusts him that much she just says that she does. Kaiba leaves the place not caring that much for the egyptian stuff, but laughing about having obtained such a powerful card and getting excited about the prospect of the tournament. Episode 61 - The Shattered Millennium Puzzle\rYugi has exchanged the brown rope for a chain in order to keep his Millennium Puzzle as safe as possible. His other self explains that this change is vital since the Millennium Puzzle connects the two, and he also senses that fate has more in store for them, specially after Shadi\u0026rsquo;s recent moves. Later that day Yugi and Anzu come across a fortune teller who Yugi believes can help him see what is in the future for him. The fortune teller asks for a personal item and suggest the Millennium Puzzle which, once in hand, he steals it. Yugi runs after him and Anzu go asking for help. She runs into Bakura and explain the situation, and then keeps running looking for Jonouchi and Honda. Bakura (once alone) uses his Millennium Ring to look after the Millennium Puzzle saying that Yugi must be the one that holds the puzzle, and that anyone who makes themselves his enemy become Bakura’s enemy as well. Yugi follows some arrows on the walls in the street and catches to the fortune teller in an old building that unexpectedly has a Duel Ring in it. The Millennium Puzzle has been locked to the duel ring and the fortune teller challenges Yugi to a duel. Even if they are apart Yugi and the other Yugi (that resides in the Puzzle) can still comunicate, but he says that he must not use the power of the puzzle since he feels that there is something strange, someone else besides this man trying to find his true identity. Yugi must have this duel alone. Meanwhile Bakura found the track and starts swapping the arrow signs to confuse anyone else following him. The duel starts, and Yugi notices that the fortune teller has a lot of machine cards. He guesses that he is Bandit Keith, and is right, but Keith is now the host of someone else that is controlling his mind: Marik Ishtar. Meanwhile Anzu finds Honda and Jonouchi and they go searching for Yugi but get confused by the arrows. Bakura watches the duel for a bit and senses that another millennium item is in play. He uses his ring to break Marik’s control. Keith is free for a moment and resists when Marik’s tries to regain control of him. Marik feels that his power is decreasing with every moment. Keith believes that all of this is because of the millennium puzzle so he smashes it to pieces. Bakura jumps and knocks Keith out. He and Yugi gather the millennium pieces and Bakura uses his power to seal a part of himself inside a piece of the puzzle. He then leaves lying that he’ll try to find Anzu and the rest to tell them that Yugi is safe, in reality his mission was completed when he manipulated the puzzle so he has no interest in searching for the others. Yugi stays a while because he can’t pull the puzzle out of the arena. Suddenly, Keith wakes up and when Marik tries to control his mind again (with some of the small control he still has, that is still rapidly dwindling) he starts smashing everything around him, knocking some fuel and starting a fire. Yugi tries to get the Puzzle out but he cant. The fire is extending quickly and Jonouchi and the rest see the smoke from a distance and follow it to the building. Anzu goes asking for help once again and Jonouchi and Honda brute force the entry. Keith runs past them escaping from the fire. They find Yugi meddling with the puzzle pieces and actually completing it once again before passing out. They try to get the puzzle out and cant, but they hear the voice of the other yugi suggesting to pull the chain with the pipes and they do, saving Yugi and the puzzle from the fire, just as firefighters arrive. After that, Yugi is shown on a hospital bed recovering from the fire and talking with his friends about the puzzle. Anzu goes to bring the others a drink and ponders about the existence of the other Yugi. Episode 62 - The Fiery Dance Battle\rA few days later, at school, Jonouchi triumphally defeats Otogi with his own deck and makes a little dance. Yugi asks Otogi about his contact with Pegasus, and he tells him that he is in contact with a representant, not Pegasus directly, but everything appears to be going well. The game is expanding worldwide and there are multiple companies making contracts to create their own cards. Yugi is shown at home at night, with the puzzle, pondering about what happened with Keith. He talks with his other self about it. At the same time Anzu falls sleep on her desks and has a dream about the other Yugi in an egyptian building, before waking up startled. Back to Yugi, he asks his other self who he is and they both talk about it. Yugi doesnt want to part ways with him though, and cries a bit about that. The following day, Honda and Jonouchi are at school talking about the upcoming Shizuka\u0026rsquo;s operation. Yugi asks Anzu if she is free that weekend to hang out with the other Yugi, and he sets the date for that sunday at domino station at 10 in the morning as he runs into the rain covering his head with his school bag. Tricked by his other half, the other Yugi is a bit awkward at first but then he relax and spends a fun day with Anzu. At one point, while drinking something, she asks if he wants to go to the egyptian museum now that it has all the stuff they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see before. He is a bit reticent to this at first. They hang out the entire day, go to the park, see a movie, and buy some card packs. They end up meeting a guy named Johnny Steps on a dance video machine and Anzu beats him dancing. He then goes after them and challenge them in “a real game”: duel monsters. Yugi is ready to accept but Anzu accepts for him, saying that she has been practicing a bit. They duel and yugi is surprised to see that Anzu holds her up pretty well against him, specially seeing that he’s not a bad duelist at all. At one point she takes a considerable advantage and is about to beat him, so she thanks Yugi for an encouraging comment he gave her. Hearing his name and finally figuring out his looks, Johnny realizes who he is and bails from the duel. But Anzu stops him when he\u0026rsquo;s running away and talks a bit with him, helping reignite his dream on being a dancer and motivating him to keep pushing for his dream and not give up. Hearing that and seeing how she dueled, the other Yugi says that he is ready to see what the Museum may hold for him. Episode 63 - The Tablet of Lost Memories\rThe night has fallen. Anzu and Yugi go into the Museum and find the old stone tablet depicting a battle between a Pharaoh and a high-ranking Priest: One looks like Yugi while the other looks like Kaiba. They meet Ishizu who gives Yugi some clues about his past. She tells Yugi that, he came to the Museum of his own will and, in doing so, has chosen the \u0026ldquo;Fate of Fighting\u0026rdquo;. If he wants to get his memories back, there\u0026rsquo;s no other choice but to gather the 7 Millennium Items. Yugi, suspicious, questions on which side is she. She challenges him to a mental duel using her Millennium Necklace. They have a short mind duel, while Anzu is unaware of what is happening, as the time for them goes way faster because they are dueling with their minds. Ishizu makes some impressive moves on her turn, but quickly surrenders after that, explaining that she has seen how this duel would play out. She calmly replies that she isn\u0026rsquo;t Yugi’s foe, but that she can see a man wielding a new Millennium Item who will show up soon enough in front of Yugi. She adds that Yugi’s battle is for the sake of gaining his memories back and that his Fate will be set in motion soon enough. The rest is for Yugi to confirm with his own eyes. She briefly uses the power of her Millennium Necklace to give both Yugi and Anzu a small vision (much shorter than Kaiba), but in this case a vision of the future: of Yugi fighting a dangerous opponent, and of the millennium rod. Ishizu excuses herself after this, and leaves for the moment. She has an internal monolog about how relieved she feels on finally finding the one her family was looking for so long, but also concerned about what will happen next, now that fate is in motion. Episode 64 - This City will Become Battle City!\rMeanwhile, in Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba has just tested in a duel against his Duel Computer the new Egyptian God card for the first time and is pleasently surprised by its power when it defeats the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (the duel is not shown, only the ultimate dragon being destroyed and Kaiba laughing). After Yugi and Anzu leave the museum they walk around for a bit and meet with Mai in front of the domino station. She has shown up for the announcement for the upcoming tournament (and jokingly teases Anzu for being on a date with Yugi). The three of them talk for a bit and spot around other familiar duelists that are near (including Kajiki, Haga, Ryuzaki and many others). Suddenly Kaiba takes control of every television screen in the city and announces his new Battle City tournament, which will start in exactly one week (the following sunday). An ante rule will be present for the rarest card of each deck, and duelists must have the new Duel Disks to enter. Becoming aware of this tournament, the holder of the Millennium Rod and leader of the Ghouls sends his Rare Hunters out to Duel and win Rare Cards for him. The following morning after the announcement of Battle City, Bakura appears in front of the Domino Museum. He is being guided by his Millennium Ring which is sensing a millennium item in the proximity. He enters the museum and after walking for a bit sees the ancient stone tablet. Ishizu appears before him and confronts him. Bakura is surprised to know that she’s a millennium item holder, revealing that his host’s father is the actual owner of the museum, much to Ishizu’s surprise. They both face in a mind duel with their respective millennium items. The duel ends up being relatively even, with no one being able to get past the other. Suddenly, Shadi shows up and interrupts their mind duel. Episode 65 - Clash of the Millennium Items!\rShadi has interrupted the duel between Bakura and Ishizu by showing himself and breaking their mental connection. Ishizu is surprised to see him here, and Bakura too. Shadi confronts Bakura accusing him of stealing Pegasus\u0026rsquo; Millennium Eye, which Bakura confirms laughing maniacally and fully retelling them their mind duels (two duels actually, first on episode 28 that Bakura lost but used his power to erase Pegasus\u0026rsquo; memory of it, and then on episode 40 that bakura won). He also confirms in front of Ishizu that he killed Shadi with his own hands years ago, and that he has no problem facing him now as a ghost. Bakura states that he is searching for all the millennium items, and points that he still needs the Scale and Ankh as well. Him and Shadi face each other in a flash of light with their millennium items (Ankh vs Ring). Ishizu runs away in the middle of the bright light and conceals her presence using the Millennium Tauk, saying that she should use it as little as possible now due to there being such a powerful antagonist near her. After the clash, Shadi vanishes too and Bakura mumbles in frustration. Bakura, weakened after those two exchanges, looks into the ancient tablet one final time and retreats saying that he needs to gather strength as he has the feeling something interesting is going to happen in the upcoming days. In his place, the real Bakura recovers control of his own body and wonder what is he doing there. Ishizu is last seen leaving the museum, as she doesn’t feel safe there. Shadi is last seen in a different place, admitting that he cannot defeat Bakura as he is now, and looking at the Scales and the Ankh pondering why he can’t extract their full powers against other millennium items holders, wondering if he’s not worthy anymore now that he’s dead.

However a Pharaoh sealed the magic away, imprisoning it in the Millennium Items. Thousands of years later Yugi Muto unlocked the secrets of the Millennium Puzzle infusing him with ancient magical energies. Destiny has chosen Yugi to prevent the return of the Shadow Games, just like the Pharaoh did. At Domino High School, Yugi is teaching his friend, Jonouchi, how to play Duel Monsters, while Honda, Anzu and Bakura watch. Yugi takes his friends to see Sugoroku\u0026rsquo;s (his grandfather) shop. The old man reveals that he has an ultra rare card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kaiba, a rich kid from school who overheard them talking about it, arrives to the place too and attempts to purchase the card but Yugi\u0026rsquo;s grandfather refuses. Later that night Kaiba calls Yugi asking him to come retrieve his grandfather as he is not feeling well and needs picking up. Kaiba had sent his employees to grab the old man and drag him to his place, where they dueled and he took his Blue-Eyes card. Kaiba welcomes Yugi and his friends at his company and tears apart the card he took from Sugoroku. He explains that he did it because already had 3 Blue-Eyes and didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted for the 4th one to be used against him. Sugoroku leaves in an ambulance but entrust Yugi his own deck. Anzu uses a marker to draw a smiley face symbol of friendship on everyone\u0026rsquo;s hands. She says that even though the ink will wash away, they will always remember the circle of their friendship. Yugi confronts Kaiba in an epic duel using his grandfather\u0026rsquo;s deck. Yugi is overwhelmed and cornered though, as Kaiba is an excellent duelist. Eventually the protagonist manages to draw the five legendary pieces of Exodia, which allow him to win the duel and cleanse the darkness in Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s heart using the power of his Millennium Puzzle. Elsewhere, Pegasus is informed that the uncontested champion Seto Kaiba has been defeated by someone named Yugi. Pegasus smiles and his golden left eye flashes. Episode 2 - The Gauntlet is Thrown\rAt school Jonouchi is dueling Anzu and is defeated by her quite easily. He still has a ton of room to improve so after a talk with Yugi he decides to ask for Sugoroku to train him into a better duelist. A few days later the Duel Monster National Tournament is taking place and the group is watching the finals on the TV between Insector Haga and Dinosaur Ryuzaki, a matchup that ends up with Haga\u0026rsquo;s victory. Pegasus J. Crawford, creator of Duel Monsters, hands the trophy to Haga and announces a new tournament of a scale never seen before that will be taking place soon. Yugi receives a delivery package in the form of a VHS tape, a gauntlet and some other things from Industrial Illusions, the company creating Duel Monster cards. He watches the VHS which happens to be a message from Pegasus inviting him to the tournament. Suddenly everything changes when the Pegasus from the TV freezes time and lures Yugi into a Shadow Game using the power of his Millennium Eye. They have a time-gated duel of 15 minutes and Yugi is shocked by Pegasus abilities to read his mind. In the end Yugi is about to deliver a final blow but the time limit is up and Pegasus wins. Using his powers, he seals Sugoroku\u0026rsquo;s soul into a card and challenges Yugi to come and recover it by defeating him face to face in the upcoming Duelist Kingdom tournament. Episode 3 - Journey to the Duelist Kingdom\rYugi and Jonouchi attend the ferry to Duelist Kingdom with Anzu and Honda who are sneaking onboard as well. Jonouchi is excited as the prospect of winning the prize money to pay for his sister Shizuka\u0026rsquo;s eye operation but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t invited to the tournament so he almost get booted by security until Yugi sees him and gives him one of his Star Chips, therefore allowing him to participate according to the rules. During the trip, Yugi and Jonouchi meet Kujaku Mai. Anzu spots Bakura from their school and wonders what is he doing there. Mai kicks Ryuzaki out of his room when she beats him in a duel. Haga, the national champion, meets Yugi and tricks him into letting him see the Exodia pieces. In a surprise twist, he throws them overboard. Jonouchi jumps in the water after them. Yugi jumps in to help Jonouchi when he struggles to keep swimming and Anzu throws a rope ladder for them both. Jonouchi is upset that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find Yugi\u0026rsquo;s cards. He talks about Shizuka who is going blind and the tournament prize money would pay for an operation to fix her eyesight. The four of them decide look into the sunrise as the island approaches in the distance. Episode 4 - Insector Combo\rThe duelists arrive to the Duelist Kingdom and the tournament starts. Pegasus, the host, reveals that it will take place in the entire island as they have to bet other duelists and collect 10 star chips to qualify to the finals. The group starts wandering around and Yugi finds Haga. They begin an all-or-nothing duel as Yugi wants payoff for what happened to the Exodia cards. It is now revealed that there are Duel Arenas scattered across the island and that the terrains they are placed on give different powerups to different monsters. Episode 5 - Ultimate Perfect Form - Great Moth\rThe hard-fought duel between Yugi and Haga continues and reaches an epic conclusion. In the end, Yugi wins and kicks Haga out of the tournament. Who would have thought that the first duelist sent home would be the Japanese champion? Episode 6 - Gorgeous Harpie Lady\rMai, who watched Yugi\u0026rsquo;s duel against Haga, has defeated a duelist and is happy with her new star chip. She then sees the group and approaches them, challenging Jonouchi to a duel as she wants to win her way to the finals first and then duel Yugi there. Jonouchi takes up this challenge, and although is outmatched and confused by her aroma tactics, he ends up pulling the shocking win thanks to the Time Wizard card he got from Yugi as a gift during the ferry. Episode 7 - Attack from the Deep\rThe group wanders around the island and find some fish being cooked near a cliff. Hungry as they are they jump to the opportunity, but then they meet Kajiki Ryota who was the one cooking those fish.

The Big Five are the board of Kaiba Corporation and want Kaiba removed from it. Meanwhile, Seto Kaiba arrives in a helicopter to the Duelist Kingdom island in search of Mokuba and encounters Yugi and the group. Yugi returns Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s deck to him (as he had been holding on to it after defeating the impersonator) and Kaiba thanks him. They talk about defeating Pegasus. Jonouchi is angered by Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s attitude and challenges him to a duel, which Kaiba accepts as he wants to try out his new Duel Disk system he\u0026rsquo;s been working on. Jonouchi is no match for Kaiba and gets stomped. Kaiba then tells them about Pegasus\u0026rsquo; mysterious powers. Sometime ago at the United States, Kaiba himself was one of Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s guests of honor in a tournament. In the final round, Pegasus was dueling a man named Bandit Keith. Pegasus just played with Keith, then wrote something on a piece of paper and called a kid from the audience. With that paper the kid managed to beat Keith in a single turn, to Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s surprise. Yugi and Kaiba may not agree on most things, but they both know that Pegasus must be stopped. Kaiba leaves the group and heads for the Pegasus\u0026rsquo; castle, unaware that Pegasus is watching him with his Millennium Eye. Episode 17 - Terror! Call of the Living Dead\rThe next morning Anzu shows up with Mai\u0026rsquo;s backpack. Mai left the group, but wrote Yugi a note saying she owes him eight Star Chips. As the gang walk through the woods, they are being spied on by three boys: Kotsuzuka, Takaido, and Satake, who all work for Bandit Keith. Keith sneaked into the Duelist Kingdom tournament to get revenge on Pegasus for what he did to him in New York City. The three spies know Yugi was the kid who defeated Seto Kaiba months earlier, so they decide to eliminate Jonouchi first. Jonouchi, wanting to go to the bathroom, splits a bit from his group but Takaido and Satake follow him and knock him unconscious. Jonouchi wakes up in a cave where a Graveyard field is located. In there he begins a spooky duel against Kotsuzuka and his Zombie monsters. Yugi and the group find Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s wallet, leading them to investigate a nearby cave. Episode 18 - Arena of Lost Souls\rYugi and the group have to deal with a number of traps until they finally reach the arena. In there, the duel between Jonouchi and Kotsuzuka continues and reaches its climax. After being overwhelmed by the indestructible zombies, Jonouchi manages to swap them into defense and destroy them for good, winning the duel. He now has eight Star Chips, meaning he only needs two more to become a finalist. As the group approaches the cave\u0026rsquo;s exit, Keith\u0026rsquo;s gang blocks the entrance with a large boulder, too heavy for any of them to budge. As punishment for losing, Keith beats up his henchmen and takes all of their Star Chips, getting a total of ten. Though this was not what he originally planned, it\u0026rsquo;s still fine by him, and he strides off alone, ready to enter Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s castle. Episode 19 - Labyrinth Tag Duel\rIn the cave, Yugi and the group have no way of removing the boulder blocking the entrance. Suddenly, Bakura\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Ring starts to point into a direction, presumably towards Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Eye. Following where the ring points, they end up at a large Dueling Arena, where the Meikyu Brothers appear, challenging them to a tag duel. Yugi and Jonouchi bet six Star Chips between them, enough to gain them entrance to Pegasus Castle if they win. But first they must get pass the eliminators and their unique field: the Labyrinth. Meanwhile, Mokuba, trapped in Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s underground prison, is thinking about his brother Seto and what happened to them when they were younger. Kaiba, on the other hand, is outside, approaching Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s castle. Episode 20 - Three Gods Combine! Gate Guardian\rThe duel in the labyrinth continues. Yugi and Jonouchi bring out their strongest monsters, but the Meikyu Brothers use clever tactics to traverse the maze and separate their monsters while they unleash all three pieces of their powerful boss monster, the \u0026ldquo;Gate Guardian\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile, as Seto Kaiba approaches Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s castle, he is confronted by Saruwatari, but Kaiba overpowers him and takes him hostage, demanding that he take him to Mokuba.

In Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s dungeon, Kaiba finds Mokuba but is soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to lock Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s soul in a card. He throws some star chips at Kaiba and tells him that if he wants to see Mokuba again, he must defeat Yugi first. Episode 22 - Duel of Destiny! Yugi vs Kaiba\rYugi and the group emerge from the underground tunnel and arrive outside Pegasus Castle. Anzu thinks about how Yugi often switches from a gentle and caring nature to a more forceful, slightly colder and unfriendlier one. She concludes there must be two Yugis after remembering his Duel with Bakura. She then recalls some time ago when she was working part-time at Burger World and she feared that Yugi and Jonouchi would reveal this to the school when they visited one day (as it was against the school rules to have a part-timme job). She admitted she was working there to raise money to travel to New York to study dance, and was shocked to find they were encouraging her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a pervert mugger with a camera, and was knocked out unconscious for a moment. She was rescued by Yugi who challenged the mugger with Duel Monster cards and Mind Crushed him. Although she was a bit hazy she remembered the confident attitude of Yugi at that time. As the group climb up the stairs to Pegasus Castle they encounter Kaiba, who challenges Yugi. Yugi accepts and they begin their duel on an open area atop the castle using Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s new-and-improved Duel Disks. Bandit Keith arrives at the castle in time to watch, but he stays out of view of the others. Episode 23 - Strongest! Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\rThe duel between Kaiba and Yugi continues and Kaiba pulls off a big combo summoning a fusion of his three Blue-Eyes while also destroying Yugi\u0026rsquo;s entire deck. The situation seems hopeless for Yugi, but encouragement from his friends and thoughts of his grandpa make him determined to carry on. Episode 24 - Kuribohs Multiply! Shocking Finale\rDespite being at the mercy of Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s fused dragon, Yugi forms a crazy counter defense while also jeopardizing his opponent monster, turning the tide completely. Kaiba becomes distressed as he knows he is going to lose the duel, and the fate of Mokuba is also in the balance for him. Yugi\u0026rsquo;s Elf Swordsman cuts off one of the dragon\u0026rsquo;s head, and another attack will defeat Kaiba. In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle battlements. It\u0026rsquo;s clear that the force of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him. Kaiba resurrects the dragon head that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi\u0026rsquo;s monster and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move, otherwise he will fall to his death. Yugi and his other self have a conflict over risking Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s life for his grandpa. The-other-Yugi launches the attack anyway, but Anzu runs to him pleading to call off the attack. Yugi regains control of his body and stops the attack just in time. Kaiba then declares an attack and wins. Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is frightened of his other self, who was willing to kill in order to win. He drops to his knees and begins to sob. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi on his weakness, but Anzu tearfully scolds him, saying that he bet his \u0026ldquo;chip of life\u0026rdquo; like it was nothing and that he is the true loser because Yugi was willing to protect Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s own life despite the outcome of the duel. Kaiba leaves, having no comeback to her words. Episode 25 - Shining Friendship\rYugi is shocked about what happened and won\u0026rsquo;t respond to his friends, even when Jonouchi offers his star chips to him. Mai shows up and offer him the Star Chips that she owed him, stating that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find all 8 but she has 6, which would be enough for him to enter the castle. But Yugi has no response. Exasperated, she challenges him to a duel for the chips but Anzu decides to take his place to everyone\u0026rsquo;s shock. The duel does not start off very well for Anzu, as Mai is just more experienced. But at some point Anzu manages to use a combination to destroy Mai\u0026rsquo;s Harpie Lady. Mai was about to activate a response but decides not to, and forfeits the duel after that. Yugi snaps out of it during the duel, seeing Anzu dueling for him. He ends up accepting Mai\u0026rsquo;s Star Chips and everyone heads towards the castle. Episode 26 - Save Mokuba!

Meanwhile, Keith schemes to find another way to get one of the cards. After the dinner, everyone splits and heads to their designated bedrooms. Mai is planning her strategy for the duel. Jonouchi is asleep in his room, dreaming and talking out loud when Keith sneaks in and steals his tournament entry card. Yugi is asleep and has a dream with his grandpa and the Kaiba brothers cards in tombstones, speaking to him asking for his help. Meanwhile, Honda suspects that Pegasus cheated in his duel against Kaiba and brings Anzu and Bakura to inspect the Dueling Arena. They find a hole that shines moonlight directly at the arena. Looking through the hole, Honda sees a tower on the other side of the courtyard and suspects that one of Pegasus\u0026rsquo; henchmen may have being spying on Kaiba\u0026rsquo;s hand using a telescope. The three climb into the tower using a grappling hook. Inside, they inspect the room and find nothing but a painting of a woman. They are soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another place. The three wake up in a passageway filled with Egyptian murals and paintings. They enter a room, where two robed men are facing each other while others behind them are chanting. The two robed men reveal stone tablets to each other. One contains a carving of a \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo; while the other has a \u0026ldquo;Crawling Dragon\u0026rdquo;. The robed man with \u0026ldquo;Crawling Dragon\u0026rdquo; loses and is consumed in green flames, as his monster was weaker than \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo;. Honda, Anzu and Bakura unintentionally make some noice seeing this, causing the robed men to notice them and surround them. The winning man reveals himself to be Pegasus. Pegasus reveals that the game he just played was one of the Shadow Games that took place in ancient Egypt, an ancient ritual where one\u0026rsquo;s very being is put to the test. He reads Anzu and Honda\u0026rsquo;s minds, to their shock, and explains what his Millennium Eye can do. When he tries to do the same to Bakura, his Millennium Ring appears and the evil Bakura takes over Bakura\u0026rsquo;s body. Pegasus is absolutely surprised about this. Then, their Millennium Items clash in a powerful beam of light. Honda and Anzu appear back in their rooms, feeling that what just had happened was a dream. In his own room, the other Bakura is happy that he has finally found the Millennium Eye. Episode 29 - Desperate Situation!

He has five minutes to find that card or he will be disqualified. Jonouchi searches all over his room for it, but to no avail. He is just about to give up when Mai comes in and gives him her card. He arrives at the Dueling Arena just in the nick of time and presents Mai\u0026rsquo;s card, to Keith\u0026rsquo;s shock. The duel between them begins, and Keith takes the advantage with his machine monsters which are immune to magic attacks.

At some point Keith has to actually cheat by pulling cards to his hand in order to re-take the advantage, but even then Jonouchi manages to find a path and deal the finishing blow. Keith, refusing to accept defeat, demands the Duel be declared invalid since Joey used Mai\u0026rsquo;s card. Jonouchi admits this is true and asks how he could have known that. Pegasus, at this point declares that Keith stole Jonouchi\u0026rsquo;s card, and that he personally doesn\u0026rsquo;t care much about which card they are holding, but he cannot condone how he cheated during the duel. Pegasus orders his guards to take Keith away, but Keith knocks them out cold, jumps towards Pegasus, and points a gun to his head, demanding the prize money.

Afterwards, Jonouchi tries to give him his \u0026ldquo;Glory of the King\u0026rsquo;s Right Hand\u0026rdquo;, but Yugi tells him to keep it since Jonouchi needs the money more than he does and Yugi is only there to rescue his grandfather.

Before the duel starts, Mr. Crocketts asks Yugi to show the \u0026ldquo;Glory of the King\u0026rsquo;s Left Hand\u0026rdquo; card to challenge the king, which he does. He explains that if he wins he will get 60% of Industrial Illusion\u0026rsquo;s stocks (in other words, if he wishes it, he will become the new president of Industrial Illusions). Pegasus then says that on the other hand, if Yugi loses the duel, he will be trapped in a card like the others. The Duel does not start off very well for Yugi, as Pegasus is able to read his mind through the use of his Millennium Eye, thereby countering any of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s moves. Meanwhile, Honda, believing Pegasus is up to something, runs off to the castle\u0026rsquo;s dungeon to find the bodies of the Kaiba brothers. He wanders around the dungeon until he finds Mokuba.

He finds him with Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s body and being cornered by two guards. Bakura uses \u0026ldquo;Chains of Magical Energy\u0026rdquo; to trap the guards (using some sort of magic to actually use the effect of a card in the real world), allowing him and Tristan to get away. However while trying to escape, they quickly reach a dead end. Episode 37 - Counterattack Begins! Mind Shuffle\rThe final duel continues. Yugi and the-other-Yugi devise a plan to counter Pegasus\u0026rsquo; Millennium Eye by repeatedly switching control of Yugi\u0026rsquo;s body each turn using the Millennium Puzzle. They will not even tell each other what cards they place on the field, making Pegasus unable to figure out their strategies. When Yugi destroys Pegasus\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Toon World\u0026rdquo; and all of his monsters, Pegasus decides to take the duel with the utmost respect and he starts a Shadow Game. Meanwhile, Honda and Bakura are cornered in the dungeon, but suddenly Bakura uses \u0026ldquo;Flesh-Eating Insect\u0026rdquo; to attack Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s guards, then sending them to the Graveyard with \u0026ldquo;Metamor Pot\u0026rdquo;. Honda realizes that Bakura is really the spirit of the Millennium Ring from before, and Bakura reveals that he wants to use Mokuba\u0026rsquo;s body for himself.

Contact between them and Yugi has been cut off, and they cannot enter the shadow cloud - they either walk straight through it or return where they started. Inside the shadow, the duel continues. The virtual simulation system from Kaiba is not working. Instead, each monster is maintained by one\u0026rsquo;s life energy, and regular Yugi cannot handle the force of the Shadow Game. The-other-Yugi takes over for a time stating that Yugi will not survive in such conditions, but Yugi convinces him to switch back to keep their Mind Shuffle strategy working. He manages to draw and set a card, but when Pegasus destroy\u0026rsquo;s his defending monster Yugi collapses. Despite his other self frantic calls, Yugi seems to be gone. This leaves just the-other-Yugi against Pegasus, who can once again read his mind and know all of his moves. Episode 39 - Fusion of Light and Darkness\rThe-other-Yugi is on the verge of defeat against Pegasus. He then gets a vision of Sugoroku, who tells him that Yugi may not physically be with him, but his spirit still is.

In a final epic turn, the-other-Yugi wins with the help of \u0026ldquo;Magician of Black Chaos\u0026rdquo;, a card summoned thanks to the final effort of Yugi himself. Pegasus is left completely shocked at his loss, as the shadow bubble dissipates. Yugi\u0026rsquo;s friends are overjoyed that he is okay and that he finally won the duel, but Anzu quickly reminds everyone that this is not over yet until Pegasus returns Kaiba, Mokuba, and Yugi\u0026rsquo;s grandfather\u0026rsquo;s souls like he promised. Yugi then turns around and is shocked to see that Pegasus has disappeared. Bakura at this point wakes up and calls out to the group. Honda reveals to Bakura that he had to get rid of the Millennium Ring as it was possessing him like before and Bakura thanks him, understanding that getting rid of it was the probably the right thing to do.

Episode 40 - King of Duelists\rHaving won the tournament, Yugi is now officially the King of Duelists. Yugi and his friends are running through the castle in order to find Pegasus, so that he will release all the souls that he captured like he promised. Anzu stops for a brief moment because she notices a nearby tower. She notes to her friends that she recognizes that tower as the one she thought that Honda and Bakura went up into before in a dream. She then realizes that was Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary and what she remembered was real. Honda agrees too as the memory is coming back to him. They decide to go there. Pegasus is in his private tower and is depressed that he lost against Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle. Regardless, he is a man of his word, so he releases the souls of Sugoroku and the Kaiba brothers. Because of this all 3 wake up and regain their senses. Just then, the evil Bakura arrives and gives Pegasus an impromptu tarot reading before challenging him to a Shadow Game using their Millennium Items. Bakura easily defeats Pegasus (who\u0026rsquo;s still exhausted from his Shadow Game with Yugi), and takes his Millennium Eye. Yugi and the gang arrive to see Pegasus unconscious being carried away by his guards. They enter the tower and find Pegasus\u0026rsquo;s diary. Anzu reads from it, and it explains that as a teenager, he met a girl named Cyndia. They were true lovers, but just as they were about to be married, Cyndia got sick and died. Pegasus traveled all over the world trying to get her back. He wound up in Egypt, where he met a man named Shadi, who gave him the Millennium Eye. Thanks to his wish asked to the Eye he got a brief vision of her. Pegasus gets the idea that using the holographic technology of Kaiba Corporation along with the power of the Millennium Items could bring Cyndia back to life. He explains in his diary that this was his reason for hosting the Duelist Kingdom tournament, but the diary ends there. Yugi notices that there are three Soul Prison cards that are blank. That means Pegasus did release the souls of his prisoners like he had promised. As the group leaves, Shadi appears in the stairs using magic and confronts Yugi. Shadi uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi\u0026rsquo;s mind, as that is the power of his item. To his surprise, he finds two chambers in his mind, one for Yugi, and the other for the-other-Yugi. While the former is a nice room full of innocence and toys, the latter is a giant maze filled with trap doors. Shadi enters through several of them before almost falling into an endless void. Luckily, the regular Yugi saves him. In one of the chambers, Shadi and Yugi are walking alongside stone tablets that feature monsters from the actual Duel Monsters game. The \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo; shows up, who is about to attack them as he thinks they are intruders. Shadi plans to use the \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon\u0026rdquo; tablet below them to destroy it, but Yugi talks him out and manages to convince the \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo; to let him go. Shadi is shocked that Yugi was able to convince the \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo; that easily, given that the \u0026ldquo;Dark Magician\u0026rdquo; is it said to be the most loyal of the ancient Pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s servants. Shadi leaves Yugi\u0026rsquo;s mind, believing he is the one that will save the world from chaos. Before he leaves, Shadi warns Yugi to take great care as the thief that stole the Millennium Eye will go after Yugi\u0026rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle soon.

After releasing the 3rd and final set the KCG project is now officially finished and therefore no more development is planned for it.\nThat said after seeing enthusiasm and knowing that this had potential to be something fun we decided to keep working on the idea, but starting from scratch. We are rebooting this project taking everything we learned with KCG and expanding on it, going beyond the Duelist Kingdom Arc and asking ourselves the question: \u0026ldquo;what would have happened if the anime kept going with all these weird rules?\u0026rdquo;\nWe have a bunch of exciting things planned and a ton already in development. Also im not working alone anymore as i was in KCG so hopefully we can keep each other motivated and push some interesting concepts into a real life game that we can all play offline and hopefully online too.\nThis is the official end of the KCG project but the start of Kingdom Duels.\nIf you are interested in this project or you want to know more feel free to join our discord: https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4\nOriginal Reddit Post\n","date":"2021-04-26T16:13:08-03:00","image":"https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0013.jpg","permalink":"https://kingdomduels.com/post/whats-next-the-origin-of-kingdom-duels/","title":"What's next? The origin of Kingdom Duels"},{"content":"Release: 03 - King of Duelists. It\u0026rsquo;s finally here!\rThe King of Duelists is the third and final Core Set for the Kingdom Card Game (KCG). It includes cards from the episode 22 up to episode 40 for a total of 93 cards (85 playable cards and 8 non-playable cards), and it covers all the way to the end of the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the Anime.\nThis last set was a long-standing debt that i had here (the previous set release was a whopping 5 years ago!) so i wanted to apologize that it took so long and also thank those that were and still are interested in this small project.\nYou will find (among other things):\nNew mechanics that reflect as best as possible the events of the original show, including new Keywords and Counters. Ritual Monsters being introduced for the first time with their corresponding summoning conditions. New Alter Summon monster\u0026rsquo;s mechanics: Toon Alteration, Metal Alteration and Swarm Alteration. Symbol Cards for a variant (and optional) way of playing the game. And a bunch of new cards with weird effects and combos for you to explore. Phew! Finally!\nSo\u0026hellip; What\u0026rsquo;s next?\nI have no idea, haha. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make promises that i may not be able to keep so that\u0026rsquo;s why im calling this the \u0026ldquo;Final Core Set\u0026rdquo;, the last of the ones i originally intended for this project.\nThat said\u0026hellip; Are you interested in seeing this to develop even further beyond? Or do you think this is the best place to end it? Come and talk with us about it in our Discord: https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4\n\u0026ldquo;Now! Attack the Moon!\u0026rdquo; - The fan-made Duelist Kingdom Card Game Adaptation is back\rTL;DR: We made a Duelist Kingdom Card Game adaptation with unique cards and rules trying to make some sense to the crazy rulings of the first season of Duel Monsters and we wanted to share it with you all.\nFive years ago I made a few posts (here and here, among others) about the creation of a \u0026ldquo;Duelist Kingdom Card Game\u0026rdquo;, a variant to the official YGO card game that used specific cards and rules centered around the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the anime.\nThe idea was to try and make some sense to the wackiness of that season and all the crazy rules that they had there, in a time before the TCG was even out and the rules for it weren\u0026rsquo;t clear yet.\nSome memories from the anime rules of the time that oldies like me may remember:\nAttacking the moon with Giant Soldier of Stone to reduce the tide and clear the ocean from the terrain. Electric attack over the wet monsters increased the attack of Demon Skull. Destroy the flotation ring of the Castle of Dark Illusions to bring it down and kill the monsters beneath it. Time monsters, Undead monsters, Toon monsters, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since that. I did release two full sets of cards and the rules back then. The idea was for it to be a print-and-play project: Gather some friends, print the cards and have some fun. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a format but rather a card game variant since it used its own cards.\nIt was indeed fun, but eventually i stopped working on it and moved on. The project stayed there\u0026hellip; kinda dead. But i had a debt over there since i never ended up releasing the final batch of cards from that arc. So, fastforward several years until now: i\u0026rsquo;ve recently returned and now i wanted to share with all of you the third and final core set of that game, that covers up until the end of the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the Anime on episode 40.\nSome sample images of the project:\nA few Examples Field example Weevil vs Yugi turn 26 Yugi vs Mako turn 11 Old infographic (a bunch of things changed) A few other things from our small community:\nWe have a small subreddit that is still kicking: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDuelistKingdom We have an even smaller Discord Server recently started: https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4 You can check all the individual cards in this Deviantart account The game has also been ported to Tabletop Simulator by a dedicated fan. You can play online! Thanks for reading up until this point!\nWhat direction we take with this project now is still unclear. It will have some revision to cards, effects and rules in the following weeks but after that is still a mystery. I would love to hear your thoughts on it.\nOriginal Reddit Post\nOriginal Reddit Post - Comprehensive Post\nOriginal Reddit Post - Rules Update\nOriginal Reddit Post - PSD Template\nOriginal Reddit Post - FAQ\n","date":"2021-04-12T15:14:44-03:00","image":"https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0014.jpg","permalink":"https://kingdomduels.com/post/kcg-set-3-released/","title":"KCG Set 3 Released"},{"content":"Heyo.

But yes, Id like to finish this project so im going to work on it again.\nSo after that i went ahead and skimmed through my files and began working on it. No empty promises this time.\nI updated this subreddit a bit and i have the intention on adding a new banner or something like that one of these days.\nI decided to double down on the commitment and made a small Discord Server in case there is interest on this project going forward.
