Ishizu is surprised at seeing him having a Millennium Item, but she hasn&#39;t activated her own yet so she reveals Mudora from her hand.\rPlayer 1\rBakura hides a monster in DEF, sets a card and passes.\rPlayer 2\rIshizu plays her Millennium Tauk into the Rule Zone.\rPlayer 2\rShe uses her Mind Prediction effect (Charges 7 → 4) to try to see his hand and top 3 cards of each deck. It costs more charges than normal because Bakura has a Millennium Item Symbol active. Bakura negates the effect by paying 1 charge (6 → 5).\rPlayer 2\rShe summons Mudora (1500) in ATK and attacks the hidden monster, which is Metamor Pot (600 DEF). It is destroyed and its effect activates, making both players discard their hands and draw 5 new cards.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws and uses his Mind Compass symbol effect (Charges 5 → 4) but Ishizu activates her concealment symbol effect in response (Charges 4 → 0), negating all effects that target her.\rPlayer 1\rBakura hides a monster in DEF and passes.\rPlayer 2\rIshizu draws, she summons Gravekeeper&#39;s Priestess (1500) and activates its effect. She does not reveal any card from the top. Priestess attacks the face-down card, which is Incubus Ghost (1800 DEF). Ishizu loses 300 LP.\r2000 - 1700\rPlayer 2\rIshizu sets a card and passes her turn. During the End Phase Incubus Ghost attaches itself to Gravekeeper&#39;s Priestess, adding the Slumbering type. At this point Bakura plays Bedtime Rule card so Priestess is changed to DEF. Bakura gains 300 LP and Priestess DEF is decreased (1500 DEF → 1200 DEF).\r2300 - 1700\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He summons Seven-Armed Fiend in ATK (666), paying 666 LP.\r1634 - 1700\rPlayer 1\rHe declares an attack using the STRIKE effect, which Ishizu responds by attempting to use her face-down card, but at this moment Shadi appears, interrupting the duel which ends in a no-result.\rDNF\rEP 65 - Bakura vs Pegasus\rEP 65\rBakura vs Pegasus\rLP\rPartial Duel.

Bakura activates his Millennium Ring Mind Compass effect (Charges 7 → 6) and declares Trap. Shadi has no Traps in hand to reveal.\rPlayer 2\rShadi then plays his Millennium Key into the Rule Zone and uses its effect to force bakura to play one of the cards (Charges 7 → 4).\rPlayer 2\rHe summons Millennium Golem in ATK in the Ruins (2000 → 2600). Then, he plays on the field his Judgment of the Dead. He then goes to activate its effect but in response Bakura laughs and activates his set Magic Removal, destroying Judgment of the Dead before the subduel happens, and due to it leaving the field Shadi loses 1000 LP.\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rShadi attacks with his Millennium Golem, but the attacked card was Electric Lizard, so Millennium Golem cannot attack on its next turn.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws, he plays a monster in hidden DEF, sets the card Shadi forced him to play and passes.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws. Given than his Millennium Golem cannot attack due to Electric Lizard, Shadi figures that Bakura doesn&#39;t want his monster to be attacked.\rPlayer 2\rHe summons Destroyer Golem in a Ruins terrain (1500 → 1950) and it attacks the hidden monster, which is Chaos Pot. Chaos Pot activates its effect. Shadi is unable to summon any monster from his top 5 cards so he discards them all (Charm of Shabti, Pharaohnic Retribution Ritual, Swords of Revealing Light, Remove Trap and Soul Release). Bakura hides in DEF Flesh-Eating Insect. He discards Reaper of the Cards, Defense Seal, Incubus Ghost and Change of Heart.\rPlayer 2\rIn the End Phase Bakura uses his Millennium Ring Compass effect (Charges 6 → 5) and declares Trap. Shadi has no Traps in hand to reveal once again. Shadi then uses his own symbol to regain a charge (Charges 4 → 5).\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws, he sets a card and ends his turn.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws. He summons Man with the Eye of Wdjat in face-up DEF. Shadi uses its effect to look at Bakura&#39;s set card. It is revealed to be Diabound Ritual. Curious, Shadi uses his Millennium Item effect to see his Extra Deck (Charges 5 → 2) and sees the card mentioned in that spell. For some reason that card terrifies Shadi, and even he is not sure why. Bakura smiles but says nothing, and the card goes back to its position after this effect.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He flips his Flesh-Eating Insect into face-up DEF, targeting and destroying Man with the Eye of Wdjat.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws. He summons Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest in ATK. It attacks and destroys Flesh-Eating Insect who was in DEF. He then sets a card and uses his symbol to regain charges (Charges 2 → 3)\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He summons &#34;Hades, Demon King of the Underworld&#34;.\rPlayer 1\rHades attacks Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest but Shadi activates his trap Curse of the Millennium Shield, which equips Millennium Shield to Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest, buffing its DEF and preventing its destruction. Battle damage is halved but Bakura receives damage for his own attack (3000 - 2450 = 550 / 2 = 275 LP Self-Damage).\r1725 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rBakura sets a card and passes. He hasn&#39;t activated his Millennium Item in the last rounds, as if stating that he doesn&#39;t need it to win.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws and plays Flame Dancer in face-up DEF, using its effect on his Priest to allow it to attack with its DEF which is a fixed value of 3000 due to the shield.\rPlayer 2\rThe Priest attacks Hades, but Bakura activates his trap Cursed Document to weaken it (3000 → 1500 → 1300), so Hades has the higher ATK (2450). 1150 LP self damage.\r1725 - 0\rPlayer 2\rBakura wins.\r">

Then, he plays on the field his Judgment of the Dead. He then goes to activate its effect but in response Bakura laughs and activates his set Magic Removal, destroying Judgment of the Dead before the subduel happens, and due to it leaving the field Shadi loses 1000 LP.\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rShadi attacks with his Millennium Golem, but the attacked card was Electric Lizard, so Millennium Golem cannot attack on its next turn.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws, he plays a monster in hidden DEF, sets the card Shadi forced him to play and passes.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws. Given than his Millennium Golem cannot attack due to Electric Lizard, Shadi figures that Bakura doesn&#39;t want his monster to be attacked.\rPlayer 2\rHe summons Destroyer Golem in a Ruins terrain (1500 → 1950) and it attacks the hidden monster, which is Chaos Pot. Chaos Pot activates its effect. Shadi is unable to summon any monster from his top 5 cards so he discards them all (Charm of Shabti, Pharaohnic Retribution Ritual, Swords of Revealing Light, Remove Trap and Soul Release). Bakura hides in DEF Flesh-Eating Insect. He discards Reaper of the Cards, Defense Seal, Incubus Ghost and Change of Heart.\rPlayer 2\rIn the End Phase Bakura uses his Millennium Ring Compass effect (Charges 6 → 5) and declares Trap.

He summons Man with the Eye of Wdjat in face-up DEF. Shadi uses its effect to look at Bakura&#39;s set card. It is revealed to be Diabound Ritual. Curious, Shadi uses his Millennium Item effect to see his Extra Deck (Charges 5 → 2) and sees the card mentioned in that spell. For some reason that card terrifies Shadi, and even he is not sure why. Bakura smiles but says nothing, and the card goes back to its position after this effect.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He flips his Flesh-Eating Insect into face-up DEF, targeting and destroying Man with the Eye of Wdjat.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws. He summons Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest in ATK. It attacks and destroys Flesh-Eating Insect who was in DEF. He then sets a card and uses his symbol to regain charges (Charges 2 → 3)\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He summons &#34;Hades, Demon King of the Underworld&#34;.\rPlayer 1\rHades attacks Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest but Shadi activates his trap Curse of the Millennium Shield, which equips Millennium Shield to Gravekeeper&#39;s Priest, buffing its DEF and preventing its destruction. Battle damage is halved but Bakura receives damage for his own attack (3000 - 2450 = 550 / 2 = 275 LP Self-Damage).\r1725 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rBakura sets a card and passes. He hasn&#39;t activated his Millennium Item in the last rounds, as if stating that he doesn&#39;t need it to win.\rPlayer 2\rShadi draws and plays Flame Dancer in face-up DEF, using its effect on his Priest to allow it to attack with its DEF which is a fixed value of 3000 due to the shield.\rPlayer 2\rThe Priest attacks Hades, but Bakura activates his trap Cursed Document to weaken it (3000 → 1500 → 1300), so Hades has the higher ATK (2450). 1150 LP self damage.\r1725 - 0\rPlayer 2\rBakura wins.\r">
