Noah decides to not pay the LP to negate it thinking that he will take this opportunity to defeat Kaiba, and choose the Terrain in which Noah-Shinato is. Kaiba picks an empty &#34;Meadow&#34; Terrain.\rPlayer 2\rKaiba summons his Deckmaster to the field and activates Resurrection of the Dead to resurrect Blue-Eyes White Dragon in the zone that can battle. Then Kaiba uses his Lord of Dragon Deck Master effect to change one terrain to Dragon Valley, making its Blue-Eyes gain Field Power Bonus.
