At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 2, Toy Magician = 3)\rPlayer 1\rScott summons Lyra the Giver in ATK (1800 → 2340), who gains 4 Life Star Counters.\rPlayer 1\rZeta Reticulant who gains bonus due to Space terrain (2400 → 3120) attacks Toy Magician but Yugi activates his set Toy Box, placing Toy Magician in it, preventing it from becoming a target. He then places another &#34;Toy&#34; card from his hand in it. Inside there they are unaffected by Life Star counters. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 1, Lyra the Giver = 3)\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He releases 1 monster from his Toy Box (Toy Tank) and activates his Crimson Enchantment Ritual to Ritual Summon Dark Red Enchanter in DEF (2200 DEF), who gains 6 Life Star Counters.\rPlayer 2\rAt the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 0, Lyra the Giver = 2, Dark Red Enchanter = 5). Yugi played into defense, as he knew Scott could move at least one counter from Lyra to Zeta Reticulant to keep it on the field but he does not. As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. He activates Alien Greed Ritual, tributing his two Eva Tokens to summon Greed Quasar in ATK, it gains 7 Life Star Counters and it has 300 ATK for each star counter so 2100.\rPlayer 1\rScott then activates Lyra effect, transfering its remaining 2 Life Star Counters to it for a total of 9.

Its ATK becomes 4200.\rPlayer 1\rFinally he normal summons Eva Epsilon in ATK (1500 → 1950), so it will change any monster yugi summons into ATK position.\rPlayer 1\rAt the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 13, Lyra the Giver = 0 it is destroyed, Eva Epsilon = 3)\rPlayer 2\rAt this point Scott calls Yugi to call his other self to the duel, as he considers him weak and wants to also fight the other duelist who defeated Pegasus alongside him. The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage. He takes 1000 LP of damage instead, and Toy Magician is not destroyed, instead it gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rAt this point Yugi activates his set Strike Back, allowing him to attack with Toy Magician and negate Greed Quasar effects, which in turn sets its ATK to 0.\rPlayer 1\rToy Magician (2000) destroys Greed Quasar (0). 2000 LP damage.\r0 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rYugi wins.\rYugi doesn&#39;t get the Security Key for the next area as it is in possession of Richie, not Scott.\rEP 97 - Richie Merced vs Gekko\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rGekko draws.

In response, Richie activates Grazing Bullet, which ends up inflicting that same amount of damage to both players. Richie loses 700 LP, and Gekko 700 LP.\r400 - 0\rPlayer 2\rRichie wins.\rRichie leaves without giving them his Security Key, effectively ending Yugi&#39;s run there.\rEP 98 - Keith vs Richie Merced\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rKeith draws.

As he draws, he gets a vision of a strange world and a crystalline statue of a dragon with a sword stuck in it. He is floating in the air, but there is no one else around. Without knowing what to do, he removes the sword, freeing the dragon and bonding with it. In the real world, the card he just drew is revealed to be the figure of that very same dragon, it’s called “The Claw of Hermos” and opens up new possibilities for his deck.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi uses Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Giltia.

Yet deep down, and specially after exchanging blows during the duel, she realized the truth: Marik had shattered her spirit, and though Dartz and the others offered her a distraction, she had never truly healed. Unlike Jonouchi, who fought while leaning on the support of his friends, she had been trying to carry her pain alone.\rPlayer 1\rShe activates Burial Arm, targeting and destroying her own Harpie Lady mid-attack, negating said attack, and ending her turn.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws, but he can barely stand and he falls to the ground. Mai rushes up to him, but he cannot continue and after seeing that she is seemingly back to who she was before, he ends his turn (essentially surrendering). Second Idle Warning.\rPlayer 2\rMai wins due to Idleness Rule.\r200 - 0\rPlayer 2\rThe Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Jonouchi. She declares that she will not let his soul be taken, but he replies that it&#39;s too late and, still protecting her, pushes her out of the ever shrinking circle. In the process, his hand catches on Mai’s Orichalcos fragment and it gets removed, crumbling as the seal passes over it on its way to claim Jonouchi&#39;s soul.\rEP 112 - Rafael vs Mai\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors)\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rMai draws.

Due to Ambush Shield, Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He activates The Fang of Critias, fusing the Other Yugi&#39;s set Mirror Force to Fusion Summon Mirror Force Dragon in ATK (2800), who attacks Mirror Knight Pegasus (500 → 2800), but its shield effect activates, preventing its own destruction.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 0, Yugi 0\rPlayer 3\rThe effect of Mirror Force Dragon activates, destroying every monster with 1000 ATK or less that Dartz controls. Kyutora and all the Mirror Knights are destroyed, and at this point the Other Yugi and Kaiba find out that the souls of the ones trapped in the Mirror Knight were released and are now safe, although once again trapped in the stone tablets on the walls.\rPlayer 3\rAs Orichalcos Kyutora was destroyed, Dartz activates Shunoros Ritual to Ritual Summon Orichalcos Shunoros, equipped with Orichalcos Dexia and Orichalcos Aristeros. Shunoros gains ATK due to the amount of damage absorbed by Kyutora represented in the 12 Summoning Counters it had (0 → 6000).\rPlayer 3\rAs his monster was destroyed, Dartz activates his Martyr Curse to force Mirror Force Dragon (2800) and Shunoros (6000) to battle, and it negates the effect of Mirror Force Dragon (2800). Shunoros destroys it. 3200 LP damage. Shunoros loses 1 counter (6000 → 5500).\r2000 - 2000 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 3\rAs his life points drop to zero, Kaiba activates his set Wish of Final Effort to increase the Other Yugi&#39;s LP by Mirror Force Dragon&#39;s ATK (2800).

The Other Yugi activates Soul Shield to negate the destruction and end the battle phase, paying half his LP. Shunoros loses 1 counter (5500 → 5000).\r2000 - 1700 - 0 - 0\rDeck: 18 → 17\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws &#34;Legend of Heart&#34; and activates it. Paying 1000 LP and tributing his Elf Swordsman to special summon The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias and The Claw of Hermos from anywhere with its effects negated, and then Alter Summon with them. He summons the Knighted Alter monsters of Legendary Knight Timaeus, Legendary Knight Hermos, Legendary Knight Critias in ATK.\r2000 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 2\rDue to Legend of Heart, the Seal of Orichalcos is destroyed.\rPlayer 2\rTimaeus (2800) attacks Shunoros (5000 → 4500), the attack fails but the effect of Timaeus activate (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), negating the destruction and damage and allowing Hermos to attack Shunoros (4500 → 4000), and it happens again, negating the destruction and damage and allowing Critias to attack Shunoros (4000→ 3500), the attack fails but Shunoros now has 3500 ATK.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. Shunoros (3500) attacks Critias but the other Yugi activate the effect of Critias (gaining Protector due to its own effect) to activate Mirror Force in his graveyard, which reflects the attack, destroying Shunoros.\rDeck: 17 → 16\rPlayer 1\rAs Shunoros is destroyed, Dartz activates Ritual of the Blasphemous Leviathan to Ritual Summon The Wicked Leviathan (Wicked God Ge) in ATK (infinite). Dartz LP is reduced to 0, but he cannot lose while his Wicked God is on the field. He also activates the Rule Wicked God Pantheon. Seeing that there is a Wicked God card on the field, Anzu starts acting strange.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 1\rIn his End Phase Dartz activates his Order to an Honorable Death to force Yugi to attack his Wicked Leviathan or he would destroy his monsters.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He knows he can&#39;t attack, so he sets a card and passes.\rPlayer 2\rSuddenly, Anzu joins the duel, saying that she will help him this time, and that her deck is calling her to intercede. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP. Honda, Mokuba and The Other Yugi try to stop her but she refuses. Yugi ends his turn.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1000\rPlayer 5\rAnzu draws. She activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Yugi&#39;s Chaos Soldier. As she returned a monster from the graveyard to the field she can Special Summon from her hand Maiden of the Moonlight. Then, she uses Angel&#39;s Lifeblood to tribute Maiden of the Moonlight and Special Summon Nuvia The Wicked Goddess from her top 6 cards, and gain 300 LP. This activates the effect of Maiden of the Moonlight, allowing her to Special Summon an Angel monster from her hand, and she chooses Friendship.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rPlayer 5\rThen, she activates RItual of the Blasphemous Avatar and tribute all three monsters to Ritual Summon The Wicked Avatar, to everyone&#39;s surprise, specially to the Other Yugi.\rPlayer 5\rShe tells him that she felt a connection with that card ever since the incident in the Kaiba Corporation building, and ended up recovering the card and keeping it to herself. Due to the weird things that happened back then, she became attuned to the wicked card and could hear it. Even talk to it. Yugi warns her that the card is evil, but she insists that it is not anymore, she is sure of it. And that she will use it to help him win the duel and rescue their friends together. Dartz mocks the card, saying that its power originally was drawn from The Wicked God Ge by Pegasus, and is a pale recreation of the true power of the Leviathan. Anzu had the impulse to fight after seeing Dartz summon The Wicked God Ge, and now knows why: she says that it&#39;s because the Avatar wanted to fight it itself.\rPlayer 5\rFor a moment, the Wicked Avatar takes the shape of a completely black Anzu and then transforms into a black version of Geh. It attacks the Wicked God Geh, whose attack is infinity. The Wicked Avatar ATK also becomes infinity (it cannot add 1 to infinity so the attack is infinity). But it doesn&#39;t matter: defeating it would mean defeating dartz, and they have equal strength so they should kill eachother. However Wicked God Ge cannot be destroyed in battle with a Wicked God of equal or lower Hierarchy. The Wicked Avatar is destroyed, as Dartz laughs soundly. The impact of the attack knocks Anzu back.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. He uses Defense Seal to change Timaeus to ATK. Wicked God Ge (infinity) attacks (Dartz mills 5 cards) and destroys Legendary Knight Timaeus (2800). The Other Yugi takes infinite LP damage so his LP goes to 0. The actual Seal of Orichalcos reappears and surrounds the other Yugi, but it breaks after revealing the fact that he hasn&#39;t lost just yet. Yugi activated his set Relay Soul, to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl in DEF (1700 DEF) and attach his life to her: if she is destroyed he will lose.\r0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rDeck: 16 → 15, 10\rPlayer 1\rDartz activates Impact Revive to special summon Legendary Knight Timaeus with an ATK increase (2800 → 3300) and allowing him to attack again. Wicked God Ge attacks Dark Magician Girl (he mills 5 cards).\rDeck: 10 → 5\rPlayer 1\rThe Other Yugi activates Hermos effect to redirect the attack to itself (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), but then he gains the effect of Elf Swordsman so it cannot be destroyed by monsters with 1900 original ATK or higher (and given that Wicked God Geh original ATK is infinity, Hermos is not destroyed).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. Now that all his monsters have Protector, he uses Timaeus effect to Fusion them together into The Knight of Destiny, who copies the ATK of the strongest card on the field, becoming infinite. It (infinity) attacks Wicked God Ge (infinity). Both monsters are destroyed as they have equal stats.\rPlayer 2\rSince Dartz life was tied to Wicked God Ge, he loses the duel. Yugi still has his Dark Magician Girl, so he and Anzu agree on a shared victory.\r">

He uses Alient Zeta Ritual and tributes both of his monsters to Ritual summon Zeta Reticulant in ATK (2400).\rPlayer 1\rZeta Reticulant attack Silent Swordsman LV0 but Yugi activates his set Turn Jump. In the chain he uses Silent Swordsman LV0 Quick Effect to transform it. Scott also activates his Cosmic Space rule, and within it also the Life Stars Rule.\rPlayer 1\rThe chain resolves: All monsters gain Life Star Counters equal to their own Levels that will be removed one by one during each End Phase. When a monster runs out of Life Counters it is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.\rPlayer 1\r3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott&#39;s end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3. In the End Phase they lose 1 counter (Sand Fortress = 0 it is destroyed, Zeta Reticulant = 3).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He summons Toy Magician in DEF (1500 DEF) who gains 4 Life Star Counters.

Yugi played into defense, as he knew Scott could move at least one counter from Lyra to Zeta Reticulant to keep it on the field but he does not. As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. He activates Alien Greed Ritual, tributing his two Eva Tokens to summon Greed Quasar in ATK, it gains 7 Life Star Counters and it has 300 ATK for each star counter so 2100.\rPlayer 1\rScott then activates Lyra effect, transfering its remaining 2 Life Star Counters to it for a total of 9.

Its ATK becomes 4200.\rPlayer 1\rFinally he normal summons Eva Epsilon in ATK (1500 → 1950), so it will change any monster yugi summons into ATK position.\rPlayer 1\rAt the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 13, Lyra the Giver = 0 it is destroyed, Eva Epsilon = 3)\rPlayer 2\rAt this point Scott calls Yugi to call his other self to the duel, as he considers him weak and wants to also fight the other duelist who defeated Pegasus alongside him. The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage. He takes 1000 LP of damage instead, and Toy Magician is not destroyed, instead it gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rAt this point Yugi activates his set Strike Back, allowing him to attack with Toy Magician and negate Greed Quasar effects, which in turn sets its ATK to 0.\rPlayer 1\rToy Magician (2000) destroys Greed Quasar (0). 2000 LP damage.\r0 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rYugi wins.\rYugi doesn&#39;t get the Security Key for the next area as it is in possession of Richie, not Scott.\rEP 97 - Richie Merced vs Gekko\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rGekko draws.

Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rYako draws. He activates Devil&#39;s Sanctuary, special summoning a Metal Devil Token that has an attack equal to Yugi&#39;s LP (98 ATK).

Yako sets two cards.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws.

The Wicked Avatar becomes 4001. Yugi tributes the other two Guard Tokens to make Obelisk attack infinite, which in turn also makes The Wicked Avatar infinite (as nothing can be greater than that). Due to Hierarchy Rules, Divine monster of the same ATK but lower hierarchy will be destroyed by higher hierarchy, but Yugi activates Divine Evolution, Gekko&#39;s card, increasing its hierarchy to match the one from The Wicked Avatar. Both monsters clash and are both destroyed.\rPlayer 2\rIn that clash of light, Yugi sees Anzu who reassures him that she is fine and will be back soon. Yako on the other hand sees Pegasus, who vanishes into the air. As tears leak from Yako’s eyes, Yugi tells him that it’s time he let go. Yako replies that he’s gone, Master Pegasus is gone, it’s all over. He is about to surrender but Gekko stops him and tells him that he must keep dueling, for himself and not for the evil gods. Yako becomes resolute and he and Yugi clash one last time.\rPlayer 1\rYako draws. He pays the 500 LP of upkeep to keep the Metal Devil Token.

As he draws, he gets a vision of a strange world and a crystalline statue of a dragon with a sword stuck in it. He is floating in the air, but there is no one else around. Without knowing what to do, he removes the sword, freeing the dragon and bonding with it.

Yet deep down, and specially after exchanging blows during the duel, she realized the truth: Marik had shattered her spirit, and though Dartz and the others offered her a distraction, she had never truly healed.

He uses Fusion to fuse his Chaos Soldier and Kaiba&#39;s Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to Fusion Summon Master of Dragon Knight (5000).\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Meteorain to grant it the ability to inflict half-piercing damage It attacks and destroys Orichalcos Gigas (1500 DEF), which would inflict (5000 - 1500 = 3500 / 2 = 1750 LP) but no damage is inflicted due to Orichalcos Kyutora absorbing that damage (damage absorbed 0 &#43; 1750 = 1750 → 3 Summoning Counters (3 total)).\rPlayer 2\rDartz revives Orichalcos Gigas (900 → 1400).\rPlayer 1\rDartz skips his draw due to Orichalcos Gigas, and activates Orichalcos Deuteros, attaching it to the Seal of Orichalcos. He activates its effect to regain LP for each monster he controls. He regains 500 LP.\r2000 - 2000 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rOrichalcos Gigas (1400) attacks Master of Dragon Knight (5000) and it is destroyed by it. That should be 3600 selfdamage but Kyutora absorbs it, (damage absorbed 1750 &#43; 3600 = 5350 → 7 summoning counters (10 total)). Then Dartz revives Orichalcos Gigas (1400 → 1900)\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He sets 2 cards and summons Blade Knight in ATK (1600). He has 1 card in hand so his knight gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. Kaiba activates his set Reflect Energy to tribute his Blade Knight and allow the Other Yugi to inflict damage during the attack equal to 1/4 of the combined ATK and DEF of Dragon Master Knight (5000&#43;4000 = 9000 / 4 = 2250), but Dartz activates the second effect of Orichalcos Deuteros to tribute his Orichalcos Gigas and return Dragon of Master Knight to the hand. However The Other Yugi activates Fusion Cancel in response, returning Chaos Soldier and Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to their respective fields, but the attack was negated. Due to Deuteros, he cannot attack again this turn.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws (because his Orichalcos Gigas is no longer on the field due to tributing it). He activates Orichalcos Mirror, tributing Timeater from his hand to Ritual Summon Mirror Knight Calling in ATK (0 → 500).\rDeck: 24 → 23\rPlayer 1\rDue to Mirror Knight Calling, Dartz summons four Mirror Knight Tokens. The first of those attacks Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, gaining equal ATK to it. Dartz destroys his Shield Counter so only the Blue-Eyes is destroyed.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He sets a card. Idle warning.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. His Chaos Soldier attacks a Mirror Knight Token, but it effect also activates when attacked. Chaos Soldier is destroyed, and only one Shield Counter is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the tokens. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros. He uses the effect of Mirror Knight Calling to add Shield Counters to Mirror Knight Tokens that don&#39;t have Shield Counters.\rDeck: 23 → 22\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He activates Life-Shaving Treasure Cards to draw until he has five cards in hand. He summons Kaiser Glider in ATK (2400), who cannot be destroyed in battle with a monster with the same attack. He sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He sets a card and summons Big Shield Gardna in DEF (2600).\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the tokens. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\rDeck: 22 → 21\rPlayer 1\rKaiba activates Raise Body Heat targeting Mirror Knight&#39;s Calling and forcing it to attack. Mirror Knight Calling (500) attacks Kaiser Glider (2400) but Kaiba uses his set Ring of Destruction to destroy it and inflict destruction damage to both of them equal to its ATK (500 LP damage to Kaiba and Dartz).\r1500 - 2000 - 1500\rPlayer 1\rDestroying the Mirror Knight Calling, would also destroy the tokens, but Dartz smiles and replaces at quick speed the four tokens with four Integration Monsters of the captured souls of Pegasus, Mai, Yugi and Jonouchi. They are not longer the Token Monsters so the destruction of Mirror Knight Calling doesn&#39;t destroy them.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He uses Pot of Greed to draw two cards. Kaiser Glider (2400) attacks Mirror Knight Mai (0 → 2400) to shake Yugi off his stupor of seeing his friends there. Kaiser Glider is not destroyed by it. Dartz destroys the Shield Counter on Jonouchi to prevent Mai&#39;s destruction. Kaiba sets a card.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 1\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He then passes his turn as he is unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights, which leaves him at 300 LP. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\r2000 - 2000 - 1500\rDeck: 21 → 20\rPlayer 1\rHe activates his set Twin Bow Centaur, which will allow him to toss a coin to see if monsters in a single column are destroyed. He uses it in a column containing Mirror Knight Jonouchi and Kaiser Glider. He guessed right. Kaiser Glider is destroyed, Kaiba takes 600 LP damage. Jonouchi is not destroyed because Mirror Knight Yugi intercepts the attack, losing its Shield.\r2000 - 2000 - 900\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He summons Twilight Zone Dragon in DEF and passes.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He uses Magic Removal to destroy Twin Bow Centaur. He then passes his turn as he is unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\rDeck: 20 → 19\rPlayer 1\rHe summons Orichalcos Malevolence in ATK (1500 → 2000). It attacks Twilight Zone Dragon and Kaiba understands that using his dimensional effect would not be enough, so he let the attack be declared and activates his set Attack Guidance Barrier to redirect the attack to Big Shield Gardna, increasing its DEF by 600 (2600 DEF → 3200 DEF). The attack fails, but Orichalcos Kyutora nullifies the 1200 battle damage that Dartz would take, (damage absorbed 5350 &#43; 1200 = 6550 → 2 summoning counters (12 total)). Big Shield Gardna moves to ATK due to its own effect, and its DEF returns to normal.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He changes his Twilight Zone Dragon to DEF and sets two cards.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws, he switches his Big Shield Gardna to DEF and sets a card. He then passes his turn as he is still unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 2\rAs he ends his turn, the Yugi Knight suddenly speaks, telling to the Pharaoh that he should not hesitate to destroy them, as he has more important things to worry about.\rPlayer 2\rRafael joins the duel. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP.\r2000 - 2000 - 900 - 1000\rPlayer 4\rRafael draws. He uses Dimension Distortion to change one Terrain to a Different Dimension one and Special Summon Backup Gardna to it in DEF. Then, he activates Celestial Sword Eatos Ritual equipping it to Backup Gardna, which allows him to Ritual Summon Guardian Eatos to the field (2500).\rPlayer 4\rHe then moves the sword to Eatos (2500 → 2800). She attacks the Mai Knight, who loses her shield counter. Eatos is destroyed.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0\rPlayer 4\rSuddenly, the Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Rafael and takes out his soul for the previous duel he had lost, now that he has once again regained his dark-side and anger towards Dartz. This mean he forfeits/surrenders the current duel.\r2000 - 2000 - 900 - 0\rPlayer 4\rRafael loses.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field. He activates Orichalcos Tritos.\rDeck: 19 → 18\rPlayer 1\rHe uses the effect of Orichalcos Malevolence (2000) to switch Twilight Zone Dragon to ATK Position (1200) and attacks it. Kaiba activates his set Shrink to halve its attack, but Dartz activates the effect of Orichalcos Tritos to negate and destroy Shrink. The Other Yugi activates Ambush Shield, tributing Big Shield Gardna to empower the attack of Twilight Zone Dragon by half of its DEF, capped at 1000 (2600 / 3 = 1300 → 1000). Twilight Zone Dragon (1200 → 2200) destroys Orichalcos Malevolence (2000), but Dartz receives no damage due to Orichalcos Kyutora, (damage absorbed 6550 &#43; 200 = 6750 → 0 summoning counters (12 total)). Due to Ambush Shield, Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He activates The Fang of Critias, fusing the Other Yugi&#39;s set Mirror Force to Fusion Summon Mirror Force Dragon in ATK (2800), who attacks Mirror Knight Pegasus (500 → 2800), but its shield effect activates, preventing its own destruction.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 0, Yugi 0\rPlayer 3\rThe effect of Mirror Force Dragon activates, destroying every monster with 1000 ATK or less that Dartz controls. Kyutora and all the Mirror Knights are destroyed, and at this point the Other Yugi and Kaiba find out that the souls of the ones trapped in the Mirror Knight were released and are now safe, although once again trapped in the stone tablets on the walls.\rPlayer 3\rAs Orichalcos Kyutora was destroyed, Dartz activates Shunoros Ritual to Ritual Summon Orichalcos Shunoros, equipped with Orichalcos Dexia and Orichalcos Aristeros. Shunoros gains ATK due to the amount of damage absorbed by Kyutora represented in the 12 Summoning Counters it had (0 → 6000).\rPlayer 3\rAs his monster was destroyed, Dartz activates his Martyr Curse to force Mirror Force Dragon (2800) and Shunoros (6000) to battle, and it negates the effect of Mirror Force Dragon (2800). Shunoros destroys it. 3200 LP damage. Shunoros loses 1 counter (6000 → 5500).\r2000 - 2000 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 3\rAs his life points drop to zero, Kaiba activates his set Wish of Final Effort to increase the Other Yugi&#39;s LP by Mirror Force Dragon&#39;s ATK (2800).

He summons Elf Swordsman in DEF (1200 DEF) and sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. Orichalcos Shunoros (5500) attacks Elf Swordsman (1200 DEF). The Other Yugi activates Soul Shield to negate the destruction and end the battle phase, paying half his LP. Shunoros loses 1 counter (5500 → 5000).\r2000 - 1700 - 0 - 0\rDeck: 18 → 17\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws &#34;Legend of Heart&#34; and activates it. Paying 1000 LP and tributing his Elf Swordsman to special summon The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias and The Claw of Hermos from anywhere with its effects negated, and then Alter Summon with them. He summons the Knighted Alter monsters of Legendary Knight Timaeus, Legendary Knight Hermos, Legendary Knight Critias in ATK.\r2000 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 2\rDue to Legend of Heart, the Seal of Orichalcos is destroyed.\rPlayer 2\rTimaeus (2800) attacks Shunoros (5000 → 4500), the attack fails but the effect of Timaeus activate (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), negating the destruction and damage and allowing Hermos to attack Shunoros (4500 → 4000), and it happens again, negating the destruction and damage and allowing Critias to attack Shunoros (4000→ 3500), the attack fails but Shunoros now has 3500 ATK.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. Shunoros (3500) attacks Critias but the other Yugi activate the effect of Critias (gaining Protector due to its own effect) to activate Mirror Force in his graveyard, which reflects the attack, destroying Shunoros.\rDeck: 17 → 16\rPlayer 1\rAs Shunoros is destroyed, Dartz activates Ritual of the Blasphemous Leviathan to Ritual Summon The Wicked Leviathan (Wicked God Ge) in ATK (infinite). Dartz LP is reduced to 0, but he cannot lose while his Wicked God is on the field. He also activates the Rule Wicked God Pantheon. Seeing that there is a Wicked God card on the field, Anzu starts acting strange.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 1\rIn his End Phase Dartz activates his Order to an Honorable Death to force Yugi to attack his Wicked Leviathan or he would destroy his monsters.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He knows he can&#39;t attack, so he sets a card and passes.\rPlayer 2\rSuddenly, Anzu joins the duel, saying that she will help him this time, and that her deck is calling her to intercede. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP. Honda, Mokuba and The Other Yugi try to stop her but she refuses. Yugi ends his turn.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1000\rPlayer 5\rAnzu draws. She activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Yugi&#39;s Chaos Soldier. As she returned a monster from the graveyard to the field she can Special Summon from her hand Maiden of the Moonlight. Then, she uses Angel&#39;s Lifeblood to tribute Maiden of the Moonlight and Special Summon Nuvia The Wicked Goddess from her top 6 cards, and gain 300 LP. This activates the effect of Maiden of the Moonlight, allowing her to Special Summon an Angel monster from her hand, and she chooses Friendship.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rPlayer 5\rThen, she activates RItual of the Blasphemous Avatar and tribute all three monsters to Ritual Summon The Wicked Avatar, to everyone&#39;s surprise, specially to the Other Yugi.\rPlayer 5\rShe tells him that she felt a connection with that card ever since the incident in the Kaiba Corporation building, and ended up recovering the card and keeping it to herself. Due to the weird things that happened back then, she became attuned to the wicked card and could hear it. Even talk to it. Yugi warns her that the card is evil, but she insists that it is not anymore, she is sure of it. And that she will use it to help him win the duel and rescue their friends together. Dartz mocks the card, saying that its power originally was drawn from The Wicked God Ge by Pegasus, and is a pale recreation of the true power of the Leviathan. Anzu had the impulse to fight after seeing Dartz summon The Wicked God Ge, and now knows why: she says that it&#39;s because the Avatar wanted to fight it itself.\rPlayer 5\rFor a moment, the Wicked Avatar takes the shape of a completely black Anzu and then transforms into a black version of Geh. It attacks the Wicked God Geh, whose attack is infinity. The Wicked Avatar ATK also becomes infinity (it cannot add 1 to infinity so the attack is infinity). But it doesn&#39;t matter: defeating it would mean defeating dartz, and they have equal strength so they should kill eachother. However Wicked God Ge cannot be destroyed in battle with a Wicked God of equal or lower Hierarchy. The Wicked Avatar is destroyed, as Dartz laughs soundly. The impact of the attack knocks Anzu back.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. He uses Defense Seal to change Timaeus to ATK. Wicked God Ge (infinity) attacks (Dartz mills 5 cards) and destroys Legendary Knight Timaeus (2800). The Other Yugi takes infinite LP damage so his LP goes to 0. The actual Seal of Orichalcos reappears and surrounds the other Yugi, but it breaks after revealing the fact that he hasn&#39;t lost just yet. Yugi activated his set Relay Soul, to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl in DEF (1700 DEF) and attach his life to her: if she is destroyed he will lose.\r0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rDeck: 16 → 15, 10\rPlayer 1\rDartz activates Impact Revive to special summon Legendary Knight Timaeus with an ATK increase (2800 → 3300) and allowing him to attack again. Wicked God Ge attacks Dark Magician Girl (he mills 5 cards).\rDeck: 10 → 5\rPlayer 1\rThe Other Yugi activates Hermos effect to redirect the attack to itself (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), but then he gains the effect of Elf Swordsman so it cannot be destroyed by monsters with 1900 original ATK or higher (and given that Wicked God Geh original ATK is infinity, Hermos is not destroyed).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. Now that all his monsters have Protector, he uses Timaeus effect to Fusion them together into The Knight of Destiny, who copies the ATK of the strongest card on the field, becoming infinite. It (infinity) attacks Wicked God Ge (infinity). Both monsters are destroyed as they have equal stats.\rPlayer 2\rSince Dartz life was tied to Wicked God Ge, he loses the duel. Yugi still has his Dark Magician Girl, so he and Anzu agree on a shared victory.\r">

When a monster runs out of Life Counters it is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.\rPlayer 1\r3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott&#39;s end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3.

As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).\rPlayer 1\rScott draws.

The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position.

He summons Guardian Eatos in ATK (2500 → 3000) and equips his Celestial Sword from Gardna to Eatos (3000 → 3300).\rdeck: 14 → 12\rPlayer 1\rThe Other Yugi activates the effect of Kuribandit to tribute itself and draw 5 cards, but discard any monster he draws (he discards 2: Gazelle, Electromagnetic Turtle).\rPlayer 1\rRafael activates the effect of Eatos to send the sword to the graveyard, gaining 700 ATK and also gaining 100 times the amount of yugi&#39;s monsters in his graveyard. These are Gazelle, Electromagnetic Turtle, Kuribandit, Kuribah, Kuribeh, Kuribee, Kuriboh, Kuriboo, Kuribabylon, King&#39;s Knight, Jack&#39;s Knight, Queen&#39;s Knight. Eatos gains in total 700 &#43; 1200 ATK. (3300 → 3000 → 3700 → 4900).\rPlayer 1\rEatos (4900) attacks Dark Magician (2500), but the Other Yugi uses the effect of Electromagnetic Turtle from his graveyard to negate the battle. Eatos ATK returns to what it was (4900 → 3000).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He summons Big Shield Gardna in face-up DEF (2600 DEF), he switches Dark Magician to DEF (2100 DEF) and sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure.

Eatos attacks and destroys the hat with Big Shield Gardna.\rdeck: 12 → 10\rPlayer 1\rHe then activates Rod of Silence - Kay&#39;est, equipping it to Backup Gardna so he summons Guardian Kay&#39;est in ATK (1000 → 1500). He sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He activates Angel&#39;s Charity to draw three and discard two. One of the cards he drew was The Eye of Timaeus. He uses it, hoping it now works, and it does. He uses it in combination with his now revealed Dark Magician to Fusion Summon Amulet Dragon in ATK (2900).\rPlayer 2\rDue to its effect, the Other Yugi erodes 5 spell cards in his graveyard (known spells in graveyard: Resurrection of the Dead, Brave Attack, Magic Removal, Attack Nullification, Magical Silk Hat) and Amulet Dragon gains 200 ATK for each. Amulet Dragon (2900 → 3900) attacks and destroys Guardian Eatos (3000). 900 LP damage.\r600 - 900\rPlayer 2\rAs Guardian Eatos is destroyed, Rafael activates his set Reaper Scythe - Dreadscythe to Alter Summon Guardian Dreadscythe in its place (2500 → 3000). His effect activates, destroying Backup Gardna, Guardian Elma, Guardian Grarl, and Guardian Kay&#39;est. As the scythe equips to it, it gains ATK for every monster in his graveyard (3000 → 4000)\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure. Dreadscythe (4000) attacks and destroys Amulet Dragon (3900). 100 LP damage.\r600 - 800\rdeck: 10 → 8\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws Treasure Cards from Heaven and activates so that both have six cards in hand. He summons Dark Magician Girl in DEF (1700 DEF) and sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure. He activates Obedience to make it so that when Dreadscythe attacks a DEF monster it is switched to ATK.\rdeck: 8 → 6\rPlayer 1\rDreadscythe (4000) attacks Dark Magician Girl (1700 DEF) but she is switched to attack (2000 → 2300 due to her own effect). But the other Yugi activates Magical Pigeon to negate the attack, return Dark Magician Girl to his hand and summon two Pigeon Tokens in DEF (0 DEF). Rafael sets two cards. On the End Phase, the PIgeon Tokens are destroyed and The Other Yugi Special Summons Dark Magician Girl once again in ATK (2000 → 2300).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He activates Underworld Circle to destroy all monsters on the field, changing the terrain to graveyard. While active, players can only Special Summon a monster from their respective graveyards during each player&#39;s Main Phase 1. If a monster is destroyed it is eroded.\rPlayer 2\rThe last effect of Dreadscythe activates, which forces Rafael to discard a card to revive it. The Scythe also returns, and is equipped to it. Dreadscythe doesn&#39;t allow him to summon other monsters, so he can&#39;t use the effect of Underworld Circle. The Other Yugi summons Dark Magician in ATK (2500) and sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure. The Other Yugi uses the effect of Underworld Circle to Special Summon Jack&#39;s Knight in ATK (1900).\rdeck: 6 → 4\rPlayer 1\rGuardian Dreadscythe (4000) attacks Dark Magician, but the Other Yugi activates his set Zero Gravity to switch battle positions in the field. Rafael activates his set Spirit Hunting to switch Dreadscythe to ATK and allow it to attack and destroy all DEF Position monsters the Other Yugi controls (Dark Magician and Jack&#39;s Knight).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other yugi draws. He uses the effect of Underworld Circle to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl in ATK (2000).\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Altar of Restoration to remove the top two from his deck and add The Eye of Timaeus from his graveyard to his hand. Then he activates it with Dark Magician Girl and Fusion Summon Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight (2600) in ATK.\rPlayer 2\rDark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight uses her Strike effect on Dreadscythe, but Dreadscythe revives itself. The Other Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure. The Other Yugi uses the effect of Underworld Circle to Special Summon Queen&#39;s Knight in ATK (1500).\rdeck: 4 → 2\rPlayer 1\rRafael discard Resurrection of the Dead he drew this turn to activate Orichalcos Sword of Sealing, equipping it to Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight and negating her effects.\rPlayer 1\rDreadscythe (4000) attacks and destroys Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight (2600), which means 1400 LP of damage that would win him the duel but the Other Yugi uses his set Reduction Barrier to reduce the damage he would take by 1/10. 140 LP damage.\r600 - 660\rPlayer 2\rThe Other yugi draws and uses the effect of Underworld Circle to Special Summon Big Shield Gardna in DEF (2600).\rPlayer 2\rHe uses Pot of Greed to draw two cards. He activates Spider Web to add the Resurrection of the Dead in Rafael&#39;s graveyard to his hand, and activate it to revive Eatos in ATK and under his control, as it wasn&#39;t attached anymore after Deathscythe was resurrected the first time.\rPlayer 2\rHe activates The Claw of Hermos to fuse it with Queen&#39;s Knight and Fusion Summon Goddess Bow, equipping it to Guardian Eatos (2500 → 4000). Eatos attacks and destroys Dreadscythe.\rPlayer 2\rDreadscythe revives itself. Since Eatos battled a monster with regeneration, the Other Yugi activates the second effect of Goddess Bow to prevent Eatos from being destroyed and allowing her to attack again.\rPlayer 2\rThis loop is then repeated multiple times until it depletes Rafael&#39;s hand entirely.\rPlayer 2\rAfter Rafael&#39;s hand become empty, Dreadscythe is finally destroyed and eroded. Understanding his own cards and the symbolism of Eatos switching sides to destroy Dreadscythe, Rafael now knows what to do as he is virtually defeated.\rPlayer 1\rRafael draws 2 cards due to Guardian Treasure. He uses the effect of Underworld Circle to special summon Guardian Grarl in ATK (2500 → 3000). He then activates Soul Charge to revive his guardians by emptying his graveyard, therefore special summoning Guardian Elma, Guardian Kay&#39;est and Backup Gardna in ATK, but loses 500 LP for each monster summoned this way.\r0 - 660\rdeck: 2 → 0. He will deck out on his next turn\rPlayer 1\rThe Other Yugi wins. The Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Rafael but mysteriously it vanishes without taking his soul.\rEP 115 - Dartz vs The Other Yugi + Kaiba (+Rafael +Anzu)\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in Temple of Captive Souls (40% City, 60% Temple)\r2000 - 2000 - 2000\rSetup\rBattle Royale rules.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws.

He summons Orichalcos Gigas in DEF (1500 DEF). Then he pays 500 LP to Special Summon Orichalcos Kyutora in ATK in his backrow (500 → 1000).\r1500 - 2000 - 2000\rDartz deck: 30 → 25, 24\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He uses Fusion to Fusion Summon his Blue-Eyes White Dragon with two more in his hand, Fusion Summoning Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon in ATK (4500). He doesn&#39;t attack just yet, realizing that Gigas revives itself stronger.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He uses Fusion to fuse his Chaos Soldier and Kaiba&#39;s Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to Fusion Summon Master of Dragon Knight (5000).\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Meteorain to grant it the ability to inflict half-piercing damage It attacks and destroys Orichalcos Gigas (1500 DEF), which would inflict (5000 - 1500 = 3500 / 2 = 1750 LP) but no damage is inflicted due to Orichalcos Kyutora absorbing that damage (damage absorbed 0 &#43; 1750 = 1750 → 3 Summoning Counters (3 total)).\rPlayer 2\rDartz revives Orichalcos Gigas (900 → 1400).\rPlayer 1\rDartz skips his draw due to Orichalcos Gigas, and activates Orichalcos Deuteros, attaching it to the Seal of Orichalcos. He activates its effect to regain LP for each monster he controls. He regains 500 LP.\r2000 - 2000 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rOrichalcos Gigas (1400) attacks Master of Dragon Knight (5000) and it is destroyed by it. That should be 3600 selfdamage but Kyutora absorbs it, (damage absorbed 1750 &#43; 3600 = 5350 → 7 summoning counters (10 total)). Then Dartz revives Orichalcos Gigas (1400 → 1900)\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He sets 2 cards and summons Blade Knight in ATK (1600). He has 1 card in hand so his knight gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. Kaiba activates his set Reflect Energy to tribute his Blade Knight and allow the Other Yugi to inflict damage during the attack equal to 1/4 of the combined ATK and DEF of Dragon Master Knight (5000&#43;4000 = 9000 / 4 = 2250), but Dartz activates the second effect of Orichalcos Deuteros to tribute his Orichalcos Gigas and return Dragon of Master Knight to the hand. However The Other Yugi activates Fusion Cancel in response, returning Chaos Soldier and Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to their respective fields, but the attack was negated. Due to Deuteros, he cannot attack again this turn.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws (because his Orichalcos Gigas is no longer on the field due to tributing it). He activates Orichalcos Mirror, tributing Timeater from his hand to Ritual Summon Mirror Knight Calling in ATK (0 → 500).\rDeck: 24 → 23\rPlayer 1\rDue to Mirror Knight Calling, Dartz summons four Mirror Knight Tokens. The first of those attacks Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, gaining equal ATK to it. Dartz destroys his Shield Counter so only the Blue-Eyes is destroyed.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He sets a card. Idle warning.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. His Chaos Soldier attacks a Mirror Knight Token, but it effect also activates when attacked. Chaos Soldier is destroyed, and only one Shield Counter is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the tokens. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros. He uses the effect of Mirror Knight Calling to add Shield Counters to Mirror Knight Tokens that don&#39;t have Shield Counters.\rDeck: 23 → 22\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He activates Life-Shaving Treasure Cards to draw until he has five cards in hand. He summons Kaiser Glider in ATK (2400), who cannot be destroyed in battle with a monster with the same attack. He sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He sets a card and summons Big Shield Gardna in DEF (2600).\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the tokens. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\rDeck: 22 → 21\rPlayer 1\rKaiba activates Raise Body Heat targeting Mirror Knight&#39;s Calling and forcing it to attack. Mirror Knight Calling (500) attacks Kaiser Glider (2400) but Kaiba uses his set Ring of Destruction to destroy it and inflict destruction damage to both of them equal to its ATK (500 LP damage to Kaiba and Dartz).\r1500 - 2000 - 1500\rPlayer 1\rDestroying the Mirror Knight Calling, would also destroy the tokens, but Dartz smiles and replaces at quick speed the four tokens with four Integration Monsters of the captured souls of Pegasus, Mai, Yugi and Jonouchi. They are not longer the Token Monsters so the destruction of Mirror Knight Calling doesn&#39;t destroy them.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He uses Pot of Greed to draw two cards. Kaiser Glider (2400) attacks Mirror Knight Mai (0 → 2400) to shake Yugi off his stupor of seeing his friends there. Kaiser Glider is not destroyed by it. Dartz destroys the Shield Counter on Jonouchi to prevent Mai&#39;s destruction. Kaiba sets a card.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 1\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He then passes his turn as he is unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights, which leaves him at 300 LP. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\r2000 - 2000 - 1500\rDeck: 21 → 20\rPlayer 1\rHe activates his set Twin Bow Centaur, which will allow him to toss a coin to see if monsters in a single column are destroyed. He uses it in a column containing Mirror Knight Jonouchi and Kaiser Glider. He guessed right. Kaiser Glider is destroyed, Kaiba takes 600 LP damage. Jonouchi is not destroyed because Mirror Knight Yugi intercepts the attack, losing its Shield.\r2000 - 2000 - 900\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He summons Twilight Zone Dragon in DEF and passes.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He uses Magic Removal to destroy Twin Bow Centaur. He then passes his turn as he is unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.\rDeck: 20 → 19\rPlayer 1\rHe summons Orichalcos Malevolence in ATK (1500 → 2000). It attacks Twilight Zone Dragon and Kaiba understands that using his dimensional effect would not be enough, so he let the attack be declared and activates his set Attack Guidance Barrier to redirect the attack to Big Shield Gardna, increasing its DEF by 600 (2600 DEF → 3200 DEF). The attack fails, but Orichalcos Kyutora nullifies the 1200 battle damage that Dartz would take, (damage absorbed 5350 &#43; 1200 = 6550 → 2 summoning counters (12 total)). Big Shield Gardna moves to ATK due to its own effect, and its DEF returns to normal.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He changes his Twilight Zone Dragon to DEF and sets two cards.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws, he switches his Big Shield Gardna to DEF and sets a card. He then passes his turn as he is still unwilling to attack his friends.\rPlayer 2\rAs he ends his turn, the Yugi Knight suddenly speaks, telling to the Pharaoh that he should not hesitate to destroy them, as he has more important things to worry about.\rPlayer 2\rRafael joins the duel. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP.\r2000 - 2000 - 900 - 1000\rPlayer 4\rRafael draws. He uses Dimension Distortion to change one Terrain to a Different Dimension one and Special Summon Backup Gardna to it in DEF. Then, he activates Celestial Sword Eatos Ritual equipping it to Backup Gardna, which allows him to Ritual Summon Guardian Eatos to the field (2500).\rPlayer 4\rHe then moves the sword to Eatos (2500 → 2800). She attacks the Mai Knight, who loses her shield counter. Eatos is destroyed.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0\rPlayer 4\rSuddenly, the Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Rafael and takes out his soul for the previous duel he had lost, now that he has once again regained his dark-side and anger towards Dartz. This mean he forfeits/surrenders the current duel.\r2000 - 2000 - 900 - 0\rPlayer 4\rRafael loses.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field. He activates Orichalcos Tritos.\rDeck: 19 → 18\rPlayer 1\rHe uses the effect of Orichalcos Malevolence (2000) to switch Twilight Zone Dragon to ATK Position (1200) and attacks it. Kaiba activates his set Shrink to halve its attack, but Dartz activates the effect of Orichalcos Tritos to negate and destroy Shrink. The Other Yugi activates Ambush Shield, tributing Big Shield Gardna to empower the attack of Twilight Zone Dragon by half of its DEF, capped at 1000 (2600 / 3 = 1300 → 1000). Twilight Zone Dragon (1200 → 2200) destroys Orichalcos Malevolence (2000), but Dartz receives no damage due to Orichalcos Kyutora, (damage absorbed 6550 &#43; 200 = 6750 → 0 summoning counters (12 total)). Due to Ambush Shield, Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 3\rKaiba draws. He activates The Fang of Critias, fusing the Other Yugi&#39;s set Mirror Force to Fusion Summon Mirror Force Dragon in ATK (2800), who attacks Mirror Knight Pegasus (500 → 2800), but its shield effect activates, preventing its own destruction.\rShield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 0, Yugi 0\rPlayer 3\rThe effect of Mirror Force Dragon activates, destroying every monster with 1000 ATK or less that Dartz controls. Kyutora and all the Mirror Knights are destroyed, and at this point the Other Yugi and Kaiba find out that the souls of the ones trapped in the Mirror Knight were released and are now safe, although once again trapped in the stone tablets on the walls.\rPlayer 3\rAs Orichalcos Kyutora was destroyed, Dartz activates Shunoros Ritual to Ritual Summon Orichalcos Shunoros, equipped with Orichalcos Dexia and Orichalcos Aristeros. Shunoros gains ATK due to the amount of damage absorbed by Kyutora represented in the 12 Summoning Counters it had (0 → 6000).\rPlayer 3\rAs his monster was destroyed, Dartz activates his Martyr Curse to force Mirror Force Dragon (2800) and Shunoros (6000) to battle, and it negates the effect of Mirror Force Dragon (2800). Shunoros destroys it. 3200 LP damage. Shunoros loses 1 counter (6000 → 5500).\r2000 - 2000 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 3\rAs his life points drop to zero, Kaiba activates his set Wish of Final Effort to increase the Other Yugi&#39;s LP by Mirror Force Dragon&#39;s ATK (2800).

He summons Elf Swordsman in DEF (1200 DEF) and sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. Orichalcos Shunoros (5500) attacks Elf Swordsman (1200 DEF). The Other Yugi activates Soul Shield to negate the destruction and end the battle phase, paying half his LP. Shunoros loses 1 counter (5500 → 5000).\r2000 - 1700 - 0 - 0\rDeck: 18 → 17\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws &#34;Legend of Heart&#34; and activates it. Paying 1000 LP and tributing his Elf Swordsman to special summon The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias and The Claw of Hermos from anywhere with its effects negated, and then Alter Summon with them. He summons the Knighted Alter monsters of Legendary Knight Timaeus, Legendary Knight Hermos, Legendary Knight Critias in ATK.\r2000 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 2\rDue to Legend of Heart, the Seal of Orichalcos is destroyed.\rPlayer 2\rTimaeus (2800) attacks Shunoros (5000 → 4500), the attack fails but the effect of Timaeus activate (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), negating the destruction and damage and allowing Hermos to attack Shunoros (4500 → 4000), and it happens again, negating the destruction and damage and allowing Critias to attack Shunoros (4000→ 3500), the attack fails but Shunoros now has 3500 ATK.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. Shunoros (3500) attacks Critias but the other Yugi activate the effect of Critias (gaining Protector due to its own effect) to activate Mirror Force in his graveyard, which reflects the attack, destroying Shunoros.\rDeck: 17 → 16\rPlayer 1\rAs Shunoros is destroyed, Dartz activates Ritual of the Blasphemous Leviathan to Ritual Summon The Wicked Leviathan (Wicked God Ge) in ATK (infinite). Dartz LP is reduced to 0, but he cannot lose while his Wicked God is on the field. He also activates the Rule Wicked God Pantheon. Seeing that there is a Wicked God card on the field, Anzu starts acting strange.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0\rPlayer 1\rIn his End Phase Dartz activates his Order to an Honorable Death to force Yugi to attack his Wicked Leviathan or he would destroy his monsters.\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. He knows he can&#39;t attack, so he sets a card and passes.\rPlayer 2\rSuddenly, Anzu joins the duel, saying that she will help him this time, and that her deck is calling her to intercede. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP. Honda, Mokuba and The Other Yugi try to stop her but she refuses. Yugi ends his turn.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1000\rPlayer 5\rAnzu draws. She activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Yugi&#39;s Chaos Soldier. As she returned a monster from the graveyard to the field she can Special Summon from her hand Maiden of the Moonlight. Then, she uses Angel&#39;s Lifeblood to tribute Maiden of the Moonlight and Special Summon Nuvia The Wicked Goddess from her top 6 cards, and gain 300 LP. This activates the effect of Maiden of the Moonlight, allowing her to Special Summon an Angel monster from her hand, and she chooses Friendship.\r0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rPlayer 5\rThen, she activates RItual of the Blasphemous Avatar and tribute all three monsters to Ritual Summon The Wicked Avatar, to everyone&#39;s surprise, specially to the Other Yugi.\rPlayer 5\rShe tells him that she felt a connection with that card ever since the incident in the Kaiba Corporation building, and ended up recovering the card and keeping it to herself. Due to the weird things that happened back then, she became attuned to the wicked card and could hear it. Even talk to it. Yugi warns her that the card is evil, but she insists that it is not anymore, she is sure of it. And that she will use it to help him win the duel and rescue their friends together. Dartz mocks the card, saying that its power originally was drawn from The Wicked God Ge by Pegasus, and is a pale recreation of the true power of the Leviathan. Anzu had the impulse to fight after seeing Dartz summon The Wicked God Ge, and now knows why: she says that it&#39;s because the Avatar wanted to fight it itself.\rPlayer 5\rFor a moment, the Wicked Avatar takes the shape of a completely black Anzu and then transforms into a black version of Geh. It attacks the Wicked God Geh, whose attack is infinity. The Wicked Avatar ATK also becomes infinity (it cannot add 1 to infinity so the attack is infinity). But it doesn&#39;t matter: defeating it would mean defeating dartz, and they have equal strength so they should kill eachother. However Wicked God Ge cannot be destroyed in battle with a Wicked God of equal or lower Hierarchy. The Wicked Avatar is destroyed, as Dartz laughs soundly. The impact of the attack knocks Anzu back.\rPlayer 1\rDartz draws. He uses Defense Seal to change Timaeus to ATK. Wicked God Ge (infinity) attacks (Dartz mills 5 cards) and destroys Legendary Knight Timaeus (2800). The Other Yugi takes infinite LP damage so his LP goes to 0. The actual Seal of Orichalcos reappears and surrounds the other Yugi, but it breaks after revealing the fact that he hasn&#39;t lost just yet. Yugi activated his set Relay Soul, to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl in DEF (1700 DEF) and attach his life to her: if she is destroyed he will lose.\r0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1300\rDeck: 16 → 15, 10\rPlayer 1\rDartz activates Impact Revive to special summon Legendary Knight Timaeus with an ATK increase (2800 → 3300) and allowing him to attack again. Wicked God Ge attacks Dark Magician Girl (he mills 5 cards).\rDeck: 10 → 5\rPlayer 1\rThe Other Yugi activates Hermos effect to redirect the attack to itself (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), but then he gains the effect of Elf Swordsman so it cannot be destroyed by monsters with 1900 original ATK or higher (and given that Wicked God Geh original ATK is infinity, Hermos is not destroyed).\rPlayer 2\rThe Other Yugi draws. Now that all his monsters have Protector, he uses Timaeus effect to Fusion them together into The Knight of Destiny, who copies the ATK of the strongest card on the field, becoming infinite. It (infinity) attacks Wicked God Ge (infinity). Both monsters are destroyed as they have equal stats.\rPlayer 2\rSince Dartz life was tied to Wicked God Ge, he loses the duel. Yugi still has his Dark Magician Girl, so he and Anzu agree on a shared victory.\r">
