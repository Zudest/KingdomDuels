Yugi played into defense, as he knew Scott could move at least one counter from Lyra to Zeta Reticulant to keep it on the field but he does not. As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. He activates Alien Greed Ritual, tributing his two Eva Tokens to summon Greed Quasar in ATK, it gains 7 Life Star Counters and it has 300 ATK for each star counter so 2100.\rPlayer 1\rScott then activates Lyra effect, transfering its remaining 2 Life Star Counters to it for a total of 9. (2100 → 2700).\rPlayer 1\rGreed Quasar attacks and destroys Dark Red Enchanter, gaining its Life Star counters (5) for a total of 14.

The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage. He takes 1000 LP of damage instead, and Toy Magician is not destroyed, instead it gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rAt this point Yugi activates his set Strike Back, allowing him to attack with Toy Magician and negate Greed Quasar effects, which in turn sets its ATK to 0.\rPlayer 1\rToy Magician (2000) destroys Greed Quasar (0). 2000 LP damage.\r0 - 1000\rPlayer 1\rYugi wins.\rYugi doesn&#39;t get the Security Key for the next area as it is in possession of Richie, not Scott.\rEP 97 - Richie Merced vs Gekko\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rGekko draws.

In response, Richie activates Grazing Bullet, which ends up inflicting that same amount of damage to both players. Richie loses 700 LP, and Gekko 700 LP.\r400 - 0\rPlayer 2\rRichie wins.\rRichie leaves without giving them his Security Key, effectively ending Yugi&#39;s run there.\rEP 98 - Keith vs Richie Merced\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rKeith draws.

When a monster runs out of Life Counters it is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.\rPlayer 1\r3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott&#39;s end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3.

The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage.

Scott also activates his Cosmic Space rule, and within it also the Life Stars Rule.\rPlayer 1\rThe chain resolves: All monsters gain Life Star Counters equal to their own Levels that will be removed one by one during each End Phase. When a monster runs out of Life Counters it is destroyed.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.\rPlayer 1\rThen, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.\rPlayer 1\r3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott&#39;s end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3.

As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).\rPlayer 1\rScott draws.

The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won&#39;t duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)\rPlayer 1\rScott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi&#39;s monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage.

It has attack equal to the amount of cards on Jonouchi&#39;s field (Gilford &#43; 2 backrow cards = 3000 ATK).\rPlayer 1\rEraser attacks Gilford and destroys it. 200 LP damage. Its ATK now becomes 2000.\r1100 - 1450\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws.

He takes Fiendish Engine Ritual.\rPlayer 2\rHe then activates Graverobber to special summon Motor Violence from Keith&#39;s graveyard, and the Engine Tuner equips to it.\rPlayer 2\rHe then uses Fiendish Engine Ritual to Ritual Summon Demonic Motor Omega (2800) by tributing the Motor Violence, and again Engine Tuner equips to it (2800 → 3800). As Motor Violence leaves the field, he has to summon 1 Engine Token. He has 4 cards on the field now (Demonic Motor Omega, Engine Token, the set Time Wizard and 1 set card), but he tributes the Engine Token to search for a motor card on top of his deck. He has none, but that was not the point: he needed to reduce the cards in his field. He has 3 cards in the field now so The Wicked Eraser has 3000 ATK. Fiendish Engine attacks and destroys The Wicked Eraser. 800 LP damage.\r1100 - 1450\rPlayer 2\rThe second effect of The Wicked Eraser activates, destroying every card and terrain on the field.

Gearfried destroys it and inflicts 1100 LP damage.\r0 - 1450\rPlayer 1\rJonouchi wins.\rKeith tosses Jonouchi the Black Duel Disk, as a symbol of defeating the #1 card professor. Jonouchi gives Keith his Time Machine card back and some encouraging words, telling him to face him as a duelist instead of a demon and he&#39;ll face it anytime.\rEP 100 - Willa Mette vs Yugi\rPlayer\rAction\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in City Building (40% City, 60% Indoors).\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rWilla draws, he summons Axe Dragonute and activates Ritual of the White Horn to Ritual Summon White-Horned Dragon (2200).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws.

(Osiris 2000 → 1000 → 6000).\r2000 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rOsiris (6000) attacks and destroys White-Horned Dragon (2200) while Yugi shouts &#34;Out of the way!&#34;. 3800 LP damage.

Barbaros attacks Queen&#39;s Knight but Yugi activates his set Fusion, fusing all three to Fusion Summon Arcana Knight Joker (3800), who becomes the new attack target. Barbaros is destroyed. 1900 LP self damage.\r100 - 2000\rPlayer 1\rAs one of his monsters was destroyed, Yako activates Level Resist Wall, special summoning from his hand depending on the level. Barbaros was level 8 so Yako special summons the level 1 Angel O1 (300 DEF), the Level 3 Cassimolar (1200 DEF) and the Level 4 Leraje the God of Archery (1600 DEF). He gains his LP back from the previous turn due to the special effect of Angel O1 (1900 LP). He then normal summons Votis in DEF (1900)\r2000 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. Arcana Knight Joker attacks and destroys Votis. Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rYako draws. He uses his Ritual of the Blasphemous Eraser to summon The Wicked Eraser in ATK (0 → 4000) because Arcana Knight Joker counts as 3 for its fusion materials, plus a set card.\rPlayer 1\rEraser attacks and destroys Arcana Knight Joker. 200 LP damage.

Gaap returns to the field due to Divine Soldier Ritual effect.\rPlayer 1\rGaap gains ATK for every Divine card in Yako&#39;s hand, he reveals that he has the ritual for the wicked avatar: Gaap (2200 → 2500). Yako sets a card. As he enters the Battle Phase, Gaap activates its effect, paying 300 LP and creating an Army Token in yugi&#39;s field. Gaap (2500) attacks and destroys Army Token (1000). 1500 LP damage.\r1700 - 300\rPlayer 1\rYugi activates the effect of his Cross Counter Trap in the graveyard (as it was sent there this turn due to Eraser&#39;s death), allowing him to activate Stairway to the Underworld from his hand as he took a direct attack, special summoning Gorz (2700) and Kaien (2500) both in ATK position.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He sets a card. Gorz (2700) attacks and destroy Gaap (2500). 200 LP damage.\r1500 - 300\rPlayer 1\rYako draws, he summons Tellus the Little Angel in DEF (500 DEF).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws.

Yako sets a card.\r1500 - 99\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He discards 1 card (Dark Magician Girl) to Special Summon The Tricky (2000 ATK).\rPlayer 2\rHe activates United Attack so that Gorz and the Tricky &#34;attack together&#34;. But Yako activates his set Loss of Strength, reducing the attack of The Tricky to 0 and thus preventing it from reducing the Avatar&#39;s ATK. Gorz attacks alone and is destroyed. 1 LP selfdamage.\r1500 - 98\rPlayer 2\rAs The Tricky is now the highest attack (0), The Wicked Avatar changes its ATK too (2701 → 1). Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rYako draws. He activates Devil&#39;s Sanctuary, special summoning a Metal Devil Token that has an attack equal to Yugi&#39;s LP (98 ATK). The Wicked Avatar copies that ATK (99), and looks like a dark mist version Yugi&#39;s normal self, which scares his other self for a moment.\rPlayer 1\rThe Wicked Avatar (99) attacks The Tricky but Yugi activates Attack Nullification. Yako sets two cards.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He activates Monster Recovery, returning The Tricky to his Deck and drawing five cards.\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Shadow Guardsmen, summoning five Guard Tokens in DEF (1), but Yako activates Berserk Mode to switch them all to ATK. Yugi claims that he will use the card that belonged to Kaiba in the past to destroy his God and reclaim the building.\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Ritual of the God of Obelisk, tributing three Guard Tokens to summon Obelisk (4000) in ATK. The Wicked Avatar becomes 4001. Yugi tributes the other two Guard Tokens to make Obelisk attack infinite, which in turn also makes The Wicked Avatar infinite (as nothing can be greater than that). Due to Hierarchy Rules, Divine monster of the same ATK but lower hierarchy will be destroyed by higher hierarchy, but Yugi activates Divine Evolution, Gekko&#39;s card, increasing its hierarchy to match the one from The Wicked Avatar. Both monsters clash and are both destroyed.\rPlayer 2\rIn that clash of light, Yugi sees Anzu who reassures him that she is fine and will be back soon. Yako on the other hand sees Pegasus, who vanishes into the air. As tears leak from Yako’s eyes, Yugi tells him that it’s time he let go. Yako replies that he’s gone, Master Pegasus is gone, it’s all over. He is about to surrender but Gekko stops him and tells him that he must keep dueling, for himself and not for the evil gods. Yako becomes resolute and he and Yugi clash one last time.\rPlayer 1\rYako draws. He pays the 500 LP of upkeep to keep the Metal Devil Token. He activates Level Award, changing its level to 8, then activates Star Level Shuffle to special summon Beast King Barbaros from his graveyard in ATK (1900) in place of the Metal Devil Token.\r1000 - 98\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He activates Treasure Cards from the Heaven to allow both players to draw 6 cards. He sets a card and summons Magnet Warrior Beta in DEF (1600 DEF)\rPlayer 1\rYako draws.

It attacks and destroys Alpha and Blockman, both level 4.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. Due to Barbaros Ur own effect, it loses 500 ATK this turn as it attacked twice (3800 → 3300).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He summons Dark Magician (2500) in ATK and uses Resurrection of the Dead to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl.\rPlayer 2\rYugi activates Black Burning Magic so Dark Magician (2500 → 4500) attacks and destroys Barbaros Ur (3300). 1200 LP damage.\r0 - 98\rPlayer 2\rYugi wins.\r">
