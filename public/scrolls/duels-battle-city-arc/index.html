This convinces him to change his strategy.\rPlayer 2\rKaiba activates Silent Dead and tributes Obelisk to special summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon from his graveyard in ATK (3000 → 3900). (By doing this he negated the secret Bomb Held by a Sacrifice)\rPlayer 2\rIshizu is shocked but also hopeful, seeing that the future can be changed.

But Marik activates his set Joyful Death Agony so all the tributed monsters have their ATK become 0 when they are tributed. He also gains 400 LP for each, so he gains 1200 LP. By doing this, Ra&#39;s ATK is now 0. Due to the secondary effect of Joyful Death Agony, Bakura changes Ra to DEF position (1050 &#43; 1700 &#43; 700 = 3450 DEF)\r900 - 3200\rPlayer 2\rMarik draws.

Drillago destroys a Sheep Token.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He summons Rocket Warrior in ATK (1500). Rocket Warrior uses its strike effect in Helpoemer, reducing its ATK (2000 → 1500). In response, Marik uses his Card of Last Will to draw 2 cards.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws, but passes without doing anything.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He tributes a Sheep Token to make Panther Warrior (2000) attack Helpoemer (1500). 500 LP damage.\r1300 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rAs Helpoemer was destroyed, Marik activates his trap Hidden Soldiers, allowing him to special summon Plasma Eel from his hand in ATK (500), activating its effect and equipping itself to Panther Warrior on Jonouchi&#39;s side of the field.\rPlayer 2\rSince Helpoemer was destroyed in battle while in ATK position, it is sent to the opponent&#39;s graveyard. Jonouchi has to discard a card from his hand on each Battle Phase. During the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer&#39;s effect forces Jonouchi to discard 1 card.\rPlayer 2\rAt the End Phase, Plasma Eel effect activates decreasing the ATK of Panther Warrior (2000 → 1500).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He doesn&#39;t attack, he is enjoying damaging Jonouchi&#39;s monsters to torture him. He sets two cards and passes.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He summons Baby Dragon in face-up DEF (700 DEF). Rocket Warrior uses its Strike effect to weaken Drillago (1600 → 1100).\rPlayer 2\rAt the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer activates and Jonouchi discards a random card (Insectorum Ritual). At the end phase Plasma Eel effect activates, weakening Panther Warrior (1500 → 1000).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws.

Marik activates his set Torture Wheel and targets Rocket Warrior.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi summons Little Winguard in face-up DEF and changes Panther Warrior to DEF too. At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior&#39;s ATK decreases (1000 → 500).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. The effect of Torture Wheel activates, inflicting 250 of direct damage to Jonouchi. Then Legend Devil gains 600 ATK due to its own effect.\r1300 - 1750\rPlayer 1\rLegend Devil (2100) attacks and destroys Little Winguard (1800 DEF). Marik activates his Coffin Seller, inflicting damage every time a monster is destroyed. Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller. Marik then sets a card.\r1300 - 1700\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He activates Pot of Greed to draw 2 cards. He activates Quiz: Marik has to guess which card is the one at the bottom on the graveyard. He cannot guess correctly, and Jonouchi adds Psycho Shocker to his hand, which was discarded due to Tribute Burial.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi summons Tiger Axe (1300) and activates Psychic Ritual to Ritual summon Psycho Shocker (2400). Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller when tributing Tiger Axe. On its summon, Marik activates his trap Wicked God&#39;s Catastrophe but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it.\r1300 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rPsycho Shocker (2400) attacks and destroys Legend Devil (2100). It would be 300 LP of Damage, but Marik activates his set Protective Seal Wall of Darkness to prevent taking the damage and draws 1 card instead. He loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1250 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rAt the end of the battle phase Helpoemer activates and forces him to discard a random card (Fusion). At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior&#39;s ATK decreases (500 → 0).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. Torture Wheel activates but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it, freeing Rocket Warrior.\rPlayer 1\rHe then uses Lava Devil Ritual to tribute Psycho Shocker and Baby Dragon to Ritual Summon Lava Golem in ATK (3000) in Jonouchi&#39;s side of the field. Jonouchi loses 100 LP by Coffin Seller due to their monsters being destroyed.\r1250 - 1550\rPlayer 1\rMarik sets a card. He didn&#39;t play a monster to his side of the field so he gets an Idle Warning (Plasma Eel is on jonouchi&#39;s side of the field).\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. Marik has no monsters for him to attack so he passes.\rPlayer 2\rIn the end of the battle phase Helpoemer makes Jonouchi discard a random card (Swordsman of Landstar). Plasma Eel can&#39;t reduce the ATK of Panther Warrior anymore. At the End Phase Lava Golem inflicts 400 LP of damage to Jonouchi.\r1250 - 1150\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He activates his set Monster Relief to return Plasma Eel to his hand and then summons it on the field on face-up DEF, but he does not activate its equip effect.\rPlayer 1\rInstead, he activates Machine Duplication Technique targeting the Eel to special summon 2 Clone Tokens targeting Plasma Eel. Marik equips one Plasma Eel Token to Rocket Warrior, and another to Lava Golem. He then sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He activates Angel&#39;s Dice to roll a die and multiply the ATK of Plasma Eel by that result. He gets a four (500 → 2000). Since the ATK now exceeds 500, Machine Duplication and the two tokens are destroyed, allowing him to tribute his monsters once again. Coffin Seller does not trigger because the tokens are not sent to the graveyard.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi activates Lightning Sword Ritual and tributes all three of his monsters (Rocket Warrior, Lava Golem and Panther Warrior) to ritual summon Gilford the Lightning. He loses 150 LP due to Coffin Seller. By tributing three monsters, Gilford allows Jonouchi to battle lock Plasma Eel into ATK.\r1250 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rGilford (2800) attacks Plasma Eel (2000), but Marik activates his set Nightmare&#39;s Demon Mirror to negate the attack by discarding a card, he discards the Ritual to summon Ra.\rPlayer 2\rHelpoemer activates but Jonouchi has no more cards in hand.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He erodes Ra&#39;s Ritual from his graveyard to send Ra to the graveyard from the Extra Deck. He then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then transforms it into God Phoenix, it attacks and destroys Gilford the Lightning .\rPlayer 1\rDue to this being a Yami no Game, Jonouchi takes a lot of real damage, but somehow he is still standing due to tremendous willpower. Marik is surprised by this, as he was counting on Ra&#39;s attack to completely destroy his mind. Marik feels he is in actual danger of losing now, he has no more useful cards in hand or field, and only controls Plasma Eel (500) in ATK battle locked due to Gilford.\rPlayer 1\rAt the End Phase Ra is destroyed due to being special summoned from the graveyard. Marik loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1200 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi, barely standing, draws Gearfried the Iron Knight. He summons it in ATK (1800, which would be enough to win as Plasma Eel has only 500 ATK) but at that moment and due to his condition, he collapses.\rPlayer 2\rAs Jonouchi can&#39;t continue the duel, Marik wins.\r1200 - 0\rMarik decides not to take any card from him. The penalty game for the Shadow Game is death, and Jonouchi stops breathing for a moment but he fights and ends up in a coma.\rEP 87 - Jonouchi vs Tournament Duelist\rEP 87\rJonouchi vs Tournament Duelist\rLP\rPartial Duel.

Jonouchi has to discard a card from his hand on each Battle Phase. During the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer&#39;s effect forces Jonouchi to discard 1 card.\rPlayer 2\rAt the End Phase, Plasma Eel effect activates decreasing the ATK of Panther Warrior (2000 → 1500).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws.

He cannot guess correctly, and Jonouchi adds Psycho Shocker to his hand, which was discarded due to Tribute Burial.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi summons Tiger Axe (1300) and activates Psychic Ritual to Ritual summon Psycho Shocker (2400). Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller when tributing Tiger Axe. On its summon, Marik activates his trap Wicked God&#39;s Catastrophe but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it.\r1300 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rPsycho Shocker (2400) attacks and destroys Legend Devil (2100).

He loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1250 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rAt the end of the battle phase Helpoemer activates and forces him to discard a random card (Fusion). At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior&#39;s ATK decreases (500 → 0).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws.

Jonouchi loses 100 LP by Coffin Seller due to their monsters being destroyed.\r1250 - 1550\rPlayer 1\rMarik sets a card. He didn&#39;t play a monster to his side of the field so he gets an Idle Warning (Plasma Eel is on jonouchi&#39;s side of the field).\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. Marik has no monsters for him to attack so he passes.\rPlayer 2\rIn the end of the battle phase Helpoemer makes Jonouchi discard a random card (Swordsman of Landstar).

Marik equips one Plasma Eel Token to Rocket Warrior, and another to Lava Golem. He then sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He activates Angel&#39;s Dice to roll a die and multiply the ATK of Plasma Eel by that result. He gets a four (500 → 2000). Since the ATK now exceeds 500, Machine Duplication and the two tokens are destroyed, allowing him to tribute his monsters once again. Coffin Seller does not trigger because the tokens are not sent to the graveyard.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi activates Lightning Sword Ritual and tributes all three of his monsters (Rocket Warrior, Lava Golem and Panther Warrior) to ritual summon Gilford the Lightning. He loses 150 LP due to Coffin Seller. By tributing three monsters, Gilford allows Jonouchi to battle lock Plasma Eel into ATK.\r1250 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rGilford (2800) attacks Plasma Eel (2000), but Marik activates his set Nightmare&#39;s Demon Mirror to negate the attack by discarding a card, he discards the Ritual to summon Ra.\rPlayer 2\rHelpoemer activates but Jonouchi has no more cards in hand.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He erodes Ra&#39;s Ritual from his graveyard to send Ra to the graveyard from the Extra Deck. He then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then transforms it into God Phoenix, it attacks and destroys Gilford the Lightning .\rPlayer 1\rDue to this being a Yami no Game, Jonouchi takes a lot of real damage, but somehow he is still standing due to tremendous willpower. Marik is surprised by this, as he was counting on Ra&#39;s attack to completely destroy his mind. Marik feels he is in actual danger of losing now, he has no more useful cards in hand or field, and only controls Plasma Eel (500) in ATK battle locked due to Gilford.\rPlayer 1\rAt the End Phase Ra is destroyed due to being special summoned from the graveyard. Marik loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1200 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi, barely standing, draws Gearfried the Iron Knight. He summons it in ATK (1800, which would be enough to win as Plasma Eel has only 500 ATK) but at that moment and due to his condition, he collapses.\rPlayer 2\rAs Jonouchi can&#39;t continue the duel, Marik wins.\r1200 - 0\rMarik decides not to take any card from him.

As part of Magical Dimension effect, the attack lost its target and the second Battle Phase ends.\rPlayer 1\rAt this point Rishid arrives and helps the real Marik to partly regain control. Yugi activates Ragnarok, and since Marik was fused with Ra, a large part of him is also eroded (he cant transfer his ATK back to LP due to Ragnarok being an unstopable effect), allowing the real Marik to regain control of his body.\rPlayer 1\rMarik surrenders the duel (Surrender Card rule), banishing his evil self once and for all.\r0 - 200\rPlayer 1\rYugi wins and is crowned champion.\rYugi obtains Ritual of the Sun of God Dragon.\rEP 90 - Jonouchi vs Yugi\rEP 90\rJonouchi vs Yugi\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel not shown, open to interpretation.

He activates Dark Sanctuary changing all Terrains to &#34;Demonic Realm&#34; and Ritual Summoning 1 &#34;Onryou, Hateful Ghost&#34; and 4 &#34;Tormented Ghost&#34;s, all face-down attached to Dark Sanctuary\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws.

He summons Kuriboh in face-up DEF, and enters his Battle Phase so Bakura reattaches his ghosts.\rPlayer 2\rDark Magician Girl (2500) attacks directly, but since she was equipped with the Onryou the attack is negated, Yugi loses LP (300 LP) and Bakura heals (300 LP).\r1650 - 1500\rPlayer 2\rOn his End Phase, Bakura activates a Spirit Message card to write another letter with the Ouija Board. Current word: (DE...). At this point Yugi claims is impossible for Bakura to win through this effect as he doesn&#39;t have enough spell/trap zones to play all of his remaining Spirit Messages, but Bakura claims that the effect of Dark Sanctuary allows him to play Spell/Trap cards in his Frontrow.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He summons Critter in ATK. In the end phase he tributes it to keep Dark Sanctuary on the field, and this in turn activates the effect of Critter, adding a monster to Bakura&#39;s hand.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He summons Big Shield Gardna and enters his Battle Phase, so Bakura reattaches his ghosts and places the Onryou once again in Dark Magician Girl.\rPlayer 2\rYugi attacks with Gamma, but Bakura activates his Dark Spirit of Silence trap, attaching it to Magnet Warrior Gamma and negating its attack, forcing Yugi to attack with Dark Magician Girl who was possessed by the Onryou. Yugi loses 300 LP and Bakura gains 300 LP.\r1950 - 1200\rPlayer 2\rYugi sets two cards. On his End Phase, Bakura activates a Spirit Message card to write another letter with the Ouija Board.

Yugi then activates his Exorcism to destroy his own Kuriboh, destroying the attached cards.\rPlayer 2\rHe then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Dark Necrofear in ATK, and since it is on the field, Dark Sanctuary is destroyed, and the Terrain returns to what it was.\rPlayer 2\rOn his End Phase, Bakura activates a Spirit Message card to write another letter with the Ouija Board. Current word: (DEAT...). But without Dark Sanctuary he cannot use his frontrow to play the final letter and complete the word.\rPlayer 1\rBakura draws. He summons Jogen the Spirit Purifier and uses its effect, discarding a card and destroying Dark Necrofear, which in turn reactivates Dark Sanctuary from his Graveyard, changing the Terrain once again.\rPlayer 1\rBakura sets another copy of Dark Spirit of Silence and tributes Jogen in the End Phase to keep Dark Sanctuary on the field. He is going to be able to complete the combo at the end of Yugi&#39;s turn and win the duel.\rPlayer 2\rYugi has to draw the out or he loses the duel.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws Ritual of the God of Osiris and activates it, tributing Dark Magician Girl, Magnet Warrior Gamma and Big Shield Gardna to Ritual Summon Osiris (X000 → 3000).\rPlayer 2\rBakura tries to choose Osiris as the target for Onryou but it is destroyed by it, as it cannot possess the God.\rPlayer 2\rYugi prepares to attack, but Rishid disguised as Marik appears and uses his fake Millennium Rod to &#34;turn&#34; Bakura back into regular Bakura, who is injured (in reality, the real Marik persuaded the evil spirit within Bakura to release the real Bakura). Doing this, Bakura would use his host as a shield to prevent Yugi from attacking and winning, but eventually the evil spirit takes over and decides to take the hit himself instead of putting his host&#39;s life at risk.\rPlayer 2\rOsiris attacks directly. 3000 LP damage.\r0 - 1200\rPlayer 2\rYugi wins.\rYugi decides to get Bakura&#39;s Change of Heart instead of Necrofear Ritual.\rEP 80 - Rishid vs Jonouchi\rEP 80\rRishid vs Jonouchi\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rSecond Quarterfinal (Finalists #7 vs #2).

By doing this, Ra&#39;s ATK is now 0. Due to the secondary effect of Joyful Death Agony, Bakura changes Ra to DEF position (1050 &#43; 1700 &#43; 700 = 3450 DEF)\r900 - 3200\rPlayer 2\rMarik draws.

He activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then activates the Instant Attack and Point-to-Point Transfer effects of Ra, to allow it to attack this turn, pay all but 1 of his Life Points to increase its stats by that amount (0 → 3199). In doing this, he summons the Incarnation version of Ra, merging with it. The normal version of Marik had no idea about this special effects of Ra.\r900 - 1\rAlmost the entire body of Marik&#39;s vanishes, leaving only his hand and eye, while the rest is merged with Ra\rPlayer 2\rMarik-Ra (3199) attacks (is not affected by Vengeful Bog Spirit due to its own effect) and destroys Dark Necrofear (2200 ATK). 999 LP total damage\r0 - 1\rPlayer 2\rMarik wins.\rAs it was a Yami no Game, Bakura&#39;s body disappears, but he smiles saying that he is the darkness and he will return.\rEP 85 - Yugi vs Jonouchi vs Kaiba vs Marik\rEP 85\rYugi vs Jonouchi vs Kaiba vs Marik\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel in Duel Tower (3 arena &#43; 2 sea).

In response, Marik uses his Card of Last Will to draw 2 cards.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws, but passes without doing anything.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He tributes a Sheep Token to make Panther Warrior (2000) attack Helpoemer (1500). 500 LP damage.\r1300 - 2000\rPlayer 2\rAs Helpoemer was destroyed, Marik activates his trap Hidden Soldiers, allowing him to special summon Plasma Eel from his hand in ATK (500), activating its effect and equipping itself to Panther Warrior on Jonouchi&#39;s side of the field.\rPlayer 2\rSince Helpoemer was destroyed in battle while in ATK position, it is sent to the opponent&#39;s graveyard. Jonouchi has to discard a card from his hand on each Battle Phase. During the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer&#39;s effect forces Jonouchi to discard 1 card.\rPlayer 2\rAt the End Phase, Plasma Eel effect activates decreasing the ATK of Panther Warrior (2000 → 1500).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He doesn&#39;t attack, he is enjoying damaging Jonouchi&#39;s monsters to torture him. He sets two cards and passes.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He summons Baby Dragon in face-up DEF (700 DEF).

At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior&#39;s ATK decreases (1000 → 500).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. The effect of Torture Wheel activates, inflicting 250 of direct damage to Jonouchi. Then Legend Devil gains 600 ATK due to its own effect.\r1300 - 1750\rPlayer 1\rLegend Devil (2100) attacks and destroys Little Winguard (1800 DEF).

He activates Pot of Greed to draw 2 cards. He activates Quiz: Marik has to guess which card is the one at the bottom on the graveyard. He cannot guess correctly, and Jonouchi adds Psycho Shocker to his hand, which was discarded due to Tribute Burial.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi summons Tiger Axe (1300) and activates Psychic Ritual to Ritual summon Psycho Shocker (2400). Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller when tributing Tiger Axe. On its summon, Marik activates his trap Wicked God&#39;s Catastrophe but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it.\r1300 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rPsycho Shocker (2400) attacks and destroys Legend Devil (2100). It would be 300 LP of Damage, but Marik activates his set Protective Seal Wall of Darkness to prevent taking the damage and draws 1 card instead. He loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1250 - 1650\rPlayer 2\rAt the end of the battle phase Helpoemer activates and forces him to discard a random card (Fusion). At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior&#39;s ATK decreases (500 → 0).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. Torture Wheel activates but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it, freeing Rocket Warrior.\rPlayer 1\rHe then uses Lava Devil Ritual to tribute Psycho Shocker and Baby Dragon to Ritual Summon Lava Golem in ATK (3000) in Jonouchi&#39;s side of the field. Jonouchi loses 100 LP by Coffin Seller due to their monsters being destroyed.\r1250 - 1550\rPlayer 1\rMarik sets a card. He didn&#39;t play a monster to his side of the field so he gets an Idle Warning (Plasma Eel is on jonouchi&#39;s side of the field).\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. Marik has no monsters for him to attack so he passes.\rPlayer 2\rIn the end of the battle phase Helpoemer makes Jonouchi discard a random card (Swordsman of Landstar). Plasma Eel can&#39;t reduce the ATK of Panther Warrior anymore. At the End Phase Lava Golem inflicts 400 LP of damage to Jonouchi.\r1250 - 1150\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He activates his set Monster Relief to return Plasma Eel to his hand and then summons it on the field on face-up DEF, but he does not activate its equip effect.\rPlayer 1\rInstead, he activates Machine Duplication Technique targeting the Eel to special summon 2 Clone Tokens targeting Plasma Eel. Marik equips one Plasma Eel Token to Rocket Warrior, and another to Lava Golem. He then sets a card.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi draws. He activates Angel&#39;s Dice to roll a die and multiply the ATK of Plasma Eel by that result. He gets a four (500 → 2000). Since the ATK now exceeds 500, Machine Duplication and the two tokens are destroyed, allowing him to tribute his monsters once again. Coffin Seller does not trigger because the tokens are not sent to the graveyard.\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi activates Lightning Sword Ritual and tributes all three of his monsters (Rocket Warrior, Lava Golem and Panther Warrior) to ritual summon Gilford the Lightning. He loses 150 LP due to Coffin Seller. By tributing three monsters, Gilford allows Jonouchi to battle lock Plasma Eel into ATK.\r1250 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rGilford (2800) attacks Plasma Eel (2000), but Marik activates his set Nightmare&#39;s Demon Mirror to negate the attack by discarding a card, he discards the Ritual to summon Ra.\rPlayer 2\rHelpoemer activates but Jonouchi has no more cards in hand.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He erodes Ra&#39;s Ritual from his graveyard to send Ra to the graveyard from the Extra Deck. He then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then transforms it into God Phoenix, it attacks and destroys Gilford the Lightning .\rPlayer 1\rDue to this being a Yami no Game, Jonouchi takes a lot of real damage, but somehow he is still standing due to tremendous willpower. Marik is surprised by this, as he was counting on Ra&#39;s attack to completely destroy his mind. Marik feels he is in actual danger of losing now, he has no more useful cards in hand or field, and only controls Plasma Eel (500) in ATK battle locked due to Gilford.\rPlayer 1\rAt the End Phase Ra is destroyed due to being special summoned from the graveyard. Marik loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.\r1200 - 1000\rPlayer 2\rJonouchi, barely standing, draws Gearfried the Iron Knight. He summons it in ATK (1800, which would be enough to win as Plasma Eel has only 500 ATK) but at that moment and due to his condition, he collapses.\rPlayer 2\rAs Jonouchi can&#39;t continue the duel, Marik wins.\r1200 - 0\rMarik decides not to take any card from him.

The attack is negated. Dark Paladin gains ATK for each of the four dragons in the field now (2900 → 4900).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He activates Diffusion Wave-Motion, paying half of his LP and allowing Dark Paladin to attack all of Kaiba&#39;s monsters once each.

Duel in Duel Tower (3 arena &#43; 2 sea).\r2000 - 2000\rBefore the duel starts Kaiba gives a card to Yugi.\rSetup\rAnte Rule Setup. Marik bets Ritual of the Sun of God Dragon. Yugi bets Ritual of the God of Osiris. It&#39;s a Yami no Game from the start.\rAs the player&#39;s Life Points decrease, they lose a portion of their body.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He summons Swift-Attacking Bloodsucker Leech in DEF (1200). He erodes Ritual of the Sun God from his hand to send Ra to the graveyard. He passes.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He summons Queen&#39;s Knight in ATK (1500). Before it can attack, Marik activates Bloodsucker Leech effect, draining Queen&#39;s Knight DEF by 500 and gaining 400 LP. Due to its effect, Yugi gains 100 LP too.\r2400 - 2100\rPlayer 2\rQueen&#39;s Knight attacks and destroys the Leech. Yugi sets two cards.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He summons Juragedo in ATK (1700), who attacks and destroys Queen&#39;s Knight (1500). 200 LP damage. Marik then sets two cards.\r2400 - 1900\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. Marik activates his set &#34;Left Arm Offering&#34; to discard his hand and add Resurrection of the Dead from his Deck to his hand. Yugi then activates his set Exchange: Yugi takes Resurrection of the Dead and Marik takes Fusion Cancel.\rPlayer 2\rYugi activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Queen&#39;s Knight in ATK. He then summons King&#39;s Knight in ATK (1600) and due to its effect he summons Jack&#39;s Knight from his deck in ATK (1900).\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He sets a card and activates Treasure Cards from Heaven to make them both draw until they have 6 cards in hand. He then switches Juragedo to DEF.\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He activates Ritual of the God of Osiris to summon Osiris in ATK (0 → 6000) by tributing his three knight monsters.\rPlayer 2\rOsiris attacks Juragedo but Marik activates his set Dark Magic Regeneration to activate Resurrection of the Dead from his graveyard, reviving Ra in DEF. He then transforms it into Egyptian God Phoenix (0). The attack is redirected to it but the Phoenix cannot be destroyed by battle.\rPlayer 2\rThe effect of Osiris then activates, but it doesn&#39;t destroy Ra due to Hierarchy.\rPlayer 2\rMarik then activates Ra&#39;s Phoenix effect to make it attack and destroy Osiris. No LP damage inflicted. At the End Phase, Ra returns to the graveyard.\rPlayer 2\rMarik then activates his Zombie&#39;s Jewel to add Resurrection of the Dead from Yugi&#39;s graveyard to his hand, and allow Yugi to draw a card. Yugi draws and without looking at it he sets it to everyone&#39;s surprise. Ishizu stares at Seto in disbelief, and he asks to himself if Yugi just created a miracle. The judge of the duel tells Yugi to check the card he set, but Kaiba says that he can continue.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He uses Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then pays all but 1 of his LP (2400 → 1) to activate its second effect, increasing its ATK/DEF by that amount (0 → 2399). This fuses Ra with Marik into a single integration monster. Marik tributes Juragedo to increase Ra&#39;s ATK/DEF by that card&#39;s values (1700/1300). Ra (2399 ATK → 4099 ATK).\rene-00\rPlayer 1\rRa (2249) attacks directly but Yugi activates his set Devil&#39;s Sanctuary to special summon a Metal Devil Token in ATK. A replay happens. Marik activates his Fusion Cancel in response, stopping the attack, and gaining Ra&#39;s ATK as LP (1 → 4099 LP) due to its own quick effect. Ra is special summoned to the field from erosion but with 0 ATK. Marik sets a card. In the end phase Ra returns to the graveyard.\r4099 - 1900\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He pays 500 LP to keep his Metal Devil Token on the field.\r4099 - 1400\rPlayer 2\rHe activates Multiply to Special Summon two more Metal Devil Tokens in ATK, he then tributes all three to Ritual summon Obelisk in ATK (4000). Obelisk attacks directly. 4000 LP damage.\r99 - 1400\rPlayer 2\rMarik activates his Metal Reflect Slime, special summoning itself as a God Slime with 3000 DEF. Yugi sets a card.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He summons Revival Slime in DEF (500). He activates Fusion to fuse God Slime with Revival Slime to create Immortal God Slime in DEF (3000 DEF).\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. Obelisk attacks and destroys Immortal God Slime, but Marik activates its effect, special summoning it in DEF position.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He sets a card and summons Bowganian in ATK (1000) and activates its Strike effect to inflict 100 LP of direct damage.\r99 - 1300\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He sets a card. He summons Dark Magician Girl in ATK (2000), and makes her attack Bowganian but Marik uses his Slime Defender to redirect the attack to Immortal God Slime. 1000 LP selfdamage.\r99 - 300\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He uses his Magical Stone Excavation, discarding two cards to get Resurrection of the Dead to his hand, he cannot use it that turn though. Then he sets a card and summons Granadora in DEF (700).\rPlayer 1\rBowganian inflicts 100 LP due to its Strike effect. At this point the normal Marik takes control of Anzu&#39;s body and tells Yugi to don&#39;t hold back as he is prepared to die, he tells him to forget about him and defeat his evil self.\r99 - 200\rPlayer 2\rYugi draws. He sets two cards.\rPlayer 1\rMarik draws. He gains 500 LP due to Granadora (99 → 599 LP). He then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive The Winged Dragon of Ra in ATK (0).\r599 - 200\rPlayer 1\rMarik then transforms Ra into Egyptian God Phoenix and uses its effect to attack all opponent monsters that existed at the beginning of the battle phase, but Yugi activates his own set Resurrection of the Dead to revive Osiris in DEF (2000 DEF) and redirect the attack to it due to the Egyptian God rule effect as it was special summoned in battle, protecting Obelisk.\rPlayer 1\rMarik activates Surprise Attack From the Darkness to allow himself to get a second Battle Phase. He then pays all but 1 of his LP (599 → 1) to activate the second effect of Ra (no longer in phoenix mode) and merge with it to play its integration form (0 → 598).\r1 - 200\rPlayer 1\rYugi activates his Soul Taker to tribute Egyptian God Slime, and it counts as two tributes due to Fusion Tribute Rule so he uses it to activate Obelisk ATK infinite and allowing him to attack during Marik&#39;s battle phase. Due to Soul Taker cost, Marik gains 3000 LP.\r3001 - 200\rPlayer 1\rMarik in response tributes Bowganian (1300 ATK) and Granadora (1900 ATK) and pays all but 1 of his LP to increase Ra&#39;s ATK/DEF (598 &#43; 1300 &#43; 1900 &#43; 3000 → 6798). He then activates his set Class System to prevent Ra&#39;s destruction in that battle between divine monsters.\r1 - 200\rPlayer 1\rRa (6798) attacks Obelisk (4000) but Yugi activates his set Magical Dimension to Tribute Obelisk and special summon Dark Magician in ATK (2500), attaching Dark Magician Girl to it. As part of Magical Dimension effect, the attack lost its target and the second Battle Phase ends.\rPlayer 1\rAt this point Rishid arrives and helps the real Marik to partly regain control. Yugi activates Ragnarok, and since Marik was fused with Ra, a large part of him is also eroded (he cant transfer his ATK back to LP due to Ragnarok being an unstopable effect), allowing the real Marik to regain control of his body.\rPlayer 1\rMarik surrenders the duel (Surrender Card rule), banishing his evil self once and for all.\r0 - 200\rPlayer 1\rYugi wins and is crowned champion.\rYugi obtains Ritual of the Sun of God Dragon.\rEP 90 - Jonouchi vs Yugi\rEP 90\rJonouchi vs Yugi\rLP\rNotes\rSetup\rDuel not shown, open to interpretation. Jonouchi regains his Red-Eyes Black Dragon after this duel (he said at the start of the tournament that he would only take it back once he had become a True Duelist).\r">
