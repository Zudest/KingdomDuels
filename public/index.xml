        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-kingdom-duels&#34;&gt;What is Kingdom Duels?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingdom Duels&lt;/strong&gt; is a fan-made variant of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game played with its own set of cards and rules, directly inspired on the gameplay of the Duelist Kingdom arc of the Duel Monsters Anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a recreation of the thematic spirit of the Duelist Kingdom Arc from the Anime, adapting those &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;weird rules&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; to an actual game with fun interactions and crazy mechanics.
This game was made on an interpretation of the japanese Anime, not the Manga or the english dub. It’s mostly a nostalgic project aimed to recreate those weird moments like the iconic “Attack the Moon!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cards&#34;&gt;The Cards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Duels cards have some clear differences to regular Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. These are some of the new elements you might find in this game:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;our mod in Tabletop Simulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (you need to have &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tabletop Simulator in Steam&lt;/a&gt; to play it this way). You can use our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/deckbuilder/&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deckbuilder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to plan your decks and import it into Tabletop Simulator later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can always try the game with a &lt;strong&gt;print-and-play&lt;/strong&gt; approach, just &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/downloads/&#34; &gt;download the cards&lt;/a&gt; and print them to play with friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;card-releases&#34;&gt;Card Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this game, cards are released to the public in sets/packs which contains roughly 40 to 70 cards. Furthermore, these Sets are also sub-divided in these categories depending on what approach they have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original cards that showed up in the Duelist Kingdom arc of the anime (from episode 1 to 40). These are as accurate as possible to the japanese version of the anime, and let you recreate duels from that season faithfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a three-letter code, for example [SOE] or [KOD].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These sets are based on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/yugioh-scrolls/&#34; &gt;Yugioh Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and are a representation of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;what would have happened if the anime kept going with these rules instead of the true rules?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. They follow duels from that story (from episode 40 onwards). It is a fan-fiction retelling that changes and adapts the story (and the cards and rules) but tries to keep the main points the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also have a three-letter code, for example [LEN] or [BSN].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion Sets (wip)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These sets expand on existing mechanics and provide further support for strategies introduced in Core and Story sets. They don&amp;rsquo;t follow plot, duels or specific characters and are more flexible, being usually focused around support for specific mechanics on each set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a four-digit code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are developed with the community, and are a way for fans to design cards for the main distribution of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are currently in pre-planning stage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusory Sets (wip)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These sets represent self-contained duels between characters from different yugioh series and/or even different franchises. A sort of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What-If?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; concept for weird and unique cards, mechanics and character interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a four-digit code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are currently in pre-planning stage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Duels aims to provide a similar experience to the Duelist Kingdom arc of the anime. It follows the regular Yu-Gi-Oh! rules but with some differences. Players can agree to modify the rules (or even the cards) as much as they want (just like the writers did in the show!) Have fun!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-getting-started&#34;&gt;📄 Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-game-board&#34;&gt;🗺️ The Game Board
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;display: flex; justify-content: left; gap: 5px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;display: inline-block; margin: 0px;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
        
            &lt;a href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/img/promotion/RulesField.jpg&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration: none;&#34;&gt;
        
        
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/img/promotion/RulesField.jpg&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; alt=&#34;?&#34;&gt;
        
        
        
        
            &lt;/a&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has a &lt;strong&gt;Frontrow&lt;/strong&gt; (five card zones where you play monsters), a &lt;strong&gt;Backrow&lt;/strong&gt; (five card zones where you play spell and traps), a &lt;strong&gt;Rule Zone&lt;/strong&gt; (where you play rule cards), your &lt;strong&gt;Main Deck Zone&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Extra Deck Zone&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Graveyard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-setup&#34;&gt;🧭 Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each player begins the Duel with &lt;strong&gt;2000 Life Points&lt;/strong&gt; (LP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each player needs a &lt;strong&gt;Main Deck&lt;/strong&gt; with exactly 30 cards and an &lt;strong&gt;Extra Deck&lt;/strong&gt; with up to 20 cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the duel starts a &lt;strong&gt;Setup Phase&lt;/strong&gt; occurs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each player place their shuffled Main Deck and Extra Deck in their corresponding zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each player is allowed to activate &lt;strong&gt;Setup Rule&lt;/strong&gt; card(s) that they may have in their Extra Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The starting Terrains are placed in each side of the field.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a player didn&amp;rsquo;t play a Field Setup card, they must use 5 &amp;ldquo;Land&amp;rdquo; Terrains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players then decide who goes first (by coin toss, rock-paper-scissors, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They draw their initial &lt;strong&gt;5 cards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a player played a &amp;ldquo;Duelist Setup&amp;rdquo; Rule card, they may swap up to 2 cards from their starting hand with card(s) in the &amp;ldquo;Cardlist&amp;rdquo; of that Duelist Setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The duel begins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-turn-structure&#34;&gt;⚙️ Turn Structure

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draw Phase → Standby Phase → Main Phase 1 → Battle Phase → Main Phase 2 → End Phase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-draw-clarifications&#34;&gt;✋ Draw Clarifications
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During its Draw Phase, a player draws 1 card from their deck (even in the first turn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no hand size limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you add cards from (or to) your Deck you must shuffle it afterwards unless otherwise stated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a player can&amp;rsquo;t draw cards from its Deck then that player loses the duel by deckout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-main-phase-clarifications&#34;&gt;📌 Main Phase Clarifications
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During your turn you can perform &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; Normal Summon and unlimited Special Summons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can Normal Summon in &lt;strong&gt;face-up ATK&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;face-up DEF&lt;/strong&gt; Position Main Deck Normal monsters of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; Level without tributing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t Set monsters&lt;/strong&gt; in this game. Instead you can &lt;strong&gt;Hide&lt;/strong&gt; a monster (or &lt;strong&gt;Summon in Hidden position&lt;/strong&gt;) in face-down ATK or face-down DEF position but only if there is an effect that allows you to do so. Monsters with the &lt;strong&gt;FLIP&lt;/strong&gt; keyword can be summoned in Hidden DEF position in any terrain that they can be summoned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monsters Hidden in DEF&lt;/strong&gt; Position work exactly like face-down DEF position in the official rules. &lt;strong&gt;Monsters Hidden in ATK&lt;/strong&gt; Position are revealed during combat, but can be hidden once again after battle calculations if they are still on the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-battle-clarifications&#34;&gt;⚔️ Battle Clarifications
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; attack your opponent&amp;rsquo;s LP directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only &lt;strong&gt;one monster&lt;/strong&gt; can declare an attack on each Battle Phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacks can be &lt;strong&gt;redirected&lt;/strong&gt;. If an attack is redirected then it is now treated as an opponent attack, even during your own Battle Phase, but its source is still considered to be the original monster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;display: flex; justify-content: left; gap: 5px;&#34;&gt;

        &lt;div style=&#34;

            color: white; 
            padding: 3px; 
            font-size: 12px;
            backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
            -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
        &#34;&gt;
            Example of a field with 5 Forest Terrains and two monsters Hidden (face-down), one in ATK and one in DEF.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        
        
            &lt;/a&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of each Monster Zone in the Frontrow there will be a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Terrain Marker&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (also called &lt;strong&gt;Terrains&lt;/strong&gt;) that may give different effects to the monster card placed on top of it. They are components that recreate the diverse terrain effects of the anime, are not considered cards and are associated to the Monster Zone directly beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a Terrain Marker is &lt;strong&gt;replaced&lt;/strong&gt; by a new one then the old one must be set aside of the board in no specified zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a monster is somehow summoned in the backrow, it is considered to be in the same Terrain as the corresponding frontrow Monster Zone in the same column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Setup Rule&lt;/strong&gt; cards define the starting Terrains that will be placed on each side of the field. If you don&amp;rsquo;t play a Field Setup Rule card during the setup of the game you are playing on the default rules and you must fill your Frontrow with &amp;ldquo;Land&amp;rdquo; Terrains.&lt;/p&gt;

            In this example: &amp;#39;Beast&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Insect&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Plant monster types gain the Field Power Bonus.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Field Power Bonus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is a term that is used when a monster is receiving an additional ATK and DEF increase thanks to the Terrain it&amp;rsquo;s located on. The ATK/DEF gain through this effect corresponds to 30% of each monster&amp;rsquo;s original ATK/DEF and is printed on every card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Terrain Marker states which type and/or attribute (if any) gains the Field Power Bonus and this is represented in a specific section between the Name and Effect box.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribute Symbol&lt;/strong&gt;: can be one of the six attributes (DARK, LIGHT, FIRE, WATER, EARTH, WIND) in the original game (minus DIVINE). All cards have an attribute including spell and traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade Symbol&lt;/strong&gt;: The grade or &amp;ldquo;main icon&amp;rdquo; of a card provides specific information about how that card is played. It varies from card type and card subtype. These are &lt;strong&gt;Levels&lt;/strong&gt; (numbers 1 to 12 on top of an orange and yellow star-pattern icon), &lt;strong&gt;Glyphs&lt;/strong&gt; (icons for Normal, Equip, Continuous, Setup) and &lt;strong&gt;Charges&lt;/strong&gt; (a numeric value on top of a dark purple icon used for Symbol Rule Cards)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Power Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;: a numeric value with plus sign near the ATK/DEF that indicates how much ATK/DEF the monster gets when is receiving a field power bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect Box Icons&lt;/strong&gt;: a dark arrow icon (►) is used to split the condition to activate it and the actual effect. An empty square icon (□) is used to make a list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types&lt;/strong&gt;: Is a categorization of words that a card may have. They don&amp;rsquo;t provide effects but are used as a reference for multiple cards and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-rule-cards&#34;&gt;📜 Rule Cards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; (light green frame) are placed in the Extra Deck and can only be played into the Rule Zone. If they leave the Rule Zone they go back to the Extra Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule Cards have effects or mechanics that are added on to the current game &lt;strong&gt;ruleset&lt;/strong&gt; for as long as that Rule Card is active on the Rule Zone. These effects cannot be negated and there is no limit to the amount of cards that can be played in your Rule Zone. They may have one of the following types: &lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; (Game, Field, Duelist, Challenge), &lt;strong&gt;Symbol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; (they simply say &amp;ldquo;Rule&amp;rdquo; in their Type) have two different ways they can be activated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they have a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;KEYWORD&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;rdquo; condition, they can be activated from your Extra Deck into the Rule Zone whenever you have a face-up card in the field that has a Keyword (a Type or Attribute either in the card or mentioned in the card effect) that matches its activation condition (this is a Quick Effect unless otherwise stated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they have a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;RELIANCE&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;rdquo; condition, it means that they can only be activated by the effect of specific card listed there. If the card that activated it leaves the field then this card also leaves the field (unless it specifies that the Reliance is on activation only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are a subset of Rule cards that can only be played during the Setup Phase before the start of a duel, and each have a different treatment depending on its type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Game Setup Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are large changes that modify the entire game in a big way. They must be unanimously agreed by all duelist to be activated during the Setup Phase. Only one Game Setup Rule may be active at once between all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Field Setup Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are used to declare the 5 starting Terrain Markers you control. They are specified in a &amp;ldquo;Terrains&amp;rdquo; list, marking their positions from left to right in your side of the field.
If both players agree they can play &amp;ldquo;Matched&amp;rdquo; Field Setup Rule cards, that have the same name but different setup (for example blue side and red side). You may only play one Field Setup per duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Duelist Setup Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are a representation of a Duelist from the anime you are playing as. Duelist Setup cards have a &amp;ldquo;Cardlist&amp;rdquo; which contains card(s) that can ignore the Restricted List during Deckbuilding. They also allow you to manipulate your hand during the Setup Phase. You may only play one Duelist Setup per duel.
In the Setup Phase, after drawing their starting hand, a player may choose to replace up to 2 of those starting cards with any card listed in the Cardlist (the card must be revealed when being added to the hand, and a player can only add one individual copy of a different card this way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Challenge Setup Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are completely optional and are a way to set some self-limits for yourself during deckbuilding by having to follow the specific restrictions that the card itself defines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol Rule Cards&lt;/strong&gt; are represent objects or powers from the anime that can interfere in the duel (like the Millennium Items). They are optional to the duel, meaning that all players must unanimously agree if they want to play with them or not before the duel starts (they can also agree to let observers of the duel activate their symbol cards to influence the duel). You may only play one Symbol Rule Card per duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They work with a &amp;ldquo;charge&amp;rdquo; system which means that activating their effects (that are Quick Effects unless otherwise stated) consume a certain amount of charges that the card must have or they cannot be activated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbol Effects have a flavor name for each effect which has no impact on the gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A player can only activate one of their Symbol effects per round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbol Rule Cards must be played to the Rule Zone during your Main Phase first (as a Slow Effect unless otherwise stated), before being able to activate the effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-monster-cards&#34;&gt;🐉 Monster Cards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Monster&lt;/strong&gt; cards (yellow frame) are placed in the Main Deck (and have effects despite being called &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; monsters, unlike the original yugioh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Deck Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; (ritual, fusions, alters and integrations) have special summoning conditions that you must fulfill to play them from the Extra Deck onto the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards used for an Extra Deck summon are considered &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; of that card type (for example Fusion Materials or Ritual Materials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-fusion-monster-cards&#34;&gt;🌀 Fusion Monster Cards
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusion Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; (purple frame) represent a combination of two or more specific monsters into one single being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summon a Fusion Monster you need to have a card named &amp;ldquo;Fusion&amp;rdquo; and the required monsters in your hand and/or field, and then attach the corresponding Fusion Materials to it.
Fusion monsters are treated as having the same name as all their Fusion Materials for card effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a Fusion Material somehow enters the field as a monster while its corresponding Fusion Monster is still on the field then this new monster can&amp;rsquo;t declare an attack on the first turn it&amp;rsquo;s summoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-ritual-monster-cards&#34;&gt;🕯️ Ritual Monster Cards
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritual Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; (blue frame) represent sealed monsters being summoned to the battlefield by sacrificing cards in a ritual ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summon a Ritual Monster you need to fulfill the requirements of a specific Spell Card listed in its summoning conditions, and then send the corresponding Ritual Materials to the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spell card used to Ritual Summon usually remains on the field face-up until the ritual requirements are successfully fulfilled or the card is destroyed. The controller of that spell card can also send it to the Graveyard at will during its Main Phase.
A monster equipped to another monster is still treated as a monster on the field and therefore can be used to fulfil a Ritual Summon. This is not the case with attached monsters (unless otherwise stated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-alter-monster-cards&#34;&gt;🔃 Alter Monster Cards
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alter Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; (red frame) represent monsters that went through a transformation of some kind without merging with other monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summon an Alter Monster you need to play a card that lets you Alter Summon the specific Type while controlling a specific monster on the field listed in the conditions of the Alter Monster, and then attach the corresponding Alter Materials to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases an Alter Summon may require a certain amount of &amp;ldquo;Summoning Counters&amp;rdquo; placed on top of the specific Alter Material as part of its summoning condition. These counters are usually placed due to card effects, and are removed once the Alter Summon is completed or the Material is removed from the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alter Monster is summoned on the same zone its corresponding Alter Material was, and any Equip card active on that monster is re-equipped to the new card instead (if the new target is still valid). Any attack or effect targeting the material monster now targets the new monster (if valid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-integration-monster-cards&#34;&gt;🧍 Integration Monster Cards
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; (brown frame) represent cards that are combined with a duelist that represent you as a player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summon an Integration Monster you need to have had played a specific Duelist Setup Rule card at the beginning of the game (marked in the summon condition with curly brackets) and Erode from your hand or field the other Material(s) listed on the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to summon in Hidden ATK or Hidden DEF an Integration Summon you are not forced to reveal the eroded material card at that moment, but when you erode it you must set it clearly apart from other cards, and once your monster is revealed or the duel ends you must reveal that it is the proper material, otherwise you lose the duel instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-spell-and-trap-cards&#34;&gt;🔮 Spell and Trap Cards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spell Cards&lt;/strong&gt; (green frame) and &lt;strong&gt;Trap Cards&lt;/strong&gt; (pink frame) are placed in the Main Deck. They have Attributes like Monster Cards, and may be one of the following types: &lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Equip&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Continuous&lt;/strong&gt;. They are all Quick Effects except Equip Spells and Continuous Spells which are Slow Effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spell Cards can be activated from the hand or from the field (if they were Set face down) while Trap Cards must be Set face down in the backrow first for a turn before being able to be activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trap Cards have a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; condition which indicates that the card effect is automatically activated when that trigger is met (the player has no control over this activation). If the card says that the Trigger is &amp;ldquo;None&amp;rdquo; then you can activate the card at will (considering any other activation condition that the card may have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the player &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; activate a trap card when its Trigger is met then the player gets an Idle Warning. If there are multiple of your traps on the field whose conditions are met at the same time: you can choose how many of them to activate (min. 1) without getting an Idle Warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Trap Cards&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;ldquo;Triggers&amp;rdquo; can be flipped face-up at any time their effect speed allows it, but the effect only activates when the Trigger is met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spell and Trap cards can have the auxiliary &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Persist&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; type that indicates that the card remains a certain amount of time in the field after its activation (the condition is specified alongside the Persist type in each card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-other-cards&#34;&gt;🌈 Other Cards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few Main Deck cards that have a &lt;strong&gt;combination of two colors&lt;/strong&gt; in their frame. These cards are considered as having both their card types at the same time. They are &lt;strong&gt;Spell Monsters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Trap Monsters&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Spell Traps&lt;/strong&gt;. You can choose to play them as one card type or the other. Each card specifies how to play them with a &amp;ldquo;Play&amp;rdquo; condition on its text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token&lt;/strong&gt; cards (gray frame) must be kept aside from the game and only brought up to the board when played by an effect. Tokens are considered Normal Monsters unless otherwise stated. Tokens can&amp;rsquo;t be attached to other cards and thus cannot be used for summoning methods that attach their materials. When Tokens leave the field they are removed from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emblem&lt;/strong&gt; cards (light yellow frame) are non-playable cards that are just symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-divine-cards&#34;&gt;📿 Divine Cards
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine&lt;/strong&gt; is a special Type of cards that is usually found in monster cards but can also be found on other card types aswell. Each divine card is color-coded individually, meaning that it can have the frame color of its card type (main deck monster, fusion monster, spell, etc.) or a different color entirely. They have a special mechanic called &amp;ldquo;Hierarchy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt; is a scale that goes from 1 to 10. Divine cards of higher Hierarchy are unaffected by divine card effects of lower hierarchy. All non-Divine cards are treated as having a Hierarchy of 0. Hierarchy is represented on a card in the Type section as a single number with a different font, always as the last item in that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-terminology&#34;&gt;📃 Terminology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect Speed&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as &lt;strong&gt;Slow Speed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Quick Speed&lt;/strong&gt; (analog to Spell Speed 1 and 2 respectively, there is no Spell Speed 3). Quick Speed can respond to Slow or Quick effects, but Slow Speed can&amp;rsquo;t be used to respond to other effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue and Red&lt;/strong&gt;: Every duel has two opposing sides: Blue and Red. Players must choose which color they belong to at the beginning of the duel in the Setup Phase. Some cards reference Blue/Red Side, in which case they refer to the side controlled by the player(s) of that color. This is applicable to multiplayer rules too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tilemap&lt;/strong&gt;: Some cards can create a &amp;ldquo;Tilemap&amp;rdquo; which means that, using the artwork of that card as a reference, they create a grid of Tiles (squares) and Obstructions (black lines) for monsters and other cards to be played in. There can only be one Tilemap in the duel at a time.
A monster must be on a specific Terrain to be inside the Tilemap. Monsters inside a Tilemap can only move and attack within Tiles of that Tilemap. If a monster inside a Tilemap were to move or be moved by a card effect to a different Terrain it now moves to a different Tile instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiles&lt;/strong&gt;: Within a Tilemap, a Tile is a square in where a monster can be played in. A monster can only occupy one Tile at a time. A monster can move or be moved to another adjacent Tile horizontally or vertically (not in diagonal) if an effect allows it and the path between those tiles is not obstructed. A monster can only attack other monsters that are within one unobstructed Tile from it. A Tilemap can have Tiles of different colors with different effects, but unless otherwise stated all Tiles are White Tiles. Red Tiles and Blue Tiles (also known as Player-colored Tiles) are controlled by the respective player(s) of that color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstructions&lt;/strong&gt;: Within a Tilemap, an Obstruction is a line that separate one tile from another and prevents a monster to move through it or attack through it, unless otherwise stated. The outer limit of the Tilemap (the white space without tiles) is considered an obstruction that cannot be removed through any means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piercing Damage&lt;/strong&gt;: If a monster attacks with an ATK that is higher than the DEF of a monster in DEF Position, the attacking player inflict the difference as Battle Damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destruction Damage&lt;/strong&gt;: If a monster is destroyed by a card effect that says &amp;ldquo;apply Destruction Damage&amp;rdquo;, then the controller of that monster receives damage equal to half of its ATK (this is called ‘Destruction Damage’ and is considered Effect Damage). You can&amp;rsquo;t inflict more than 1000 LP of destruction damage per turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erode&lt;/strong&gt;: If a card is eroded it means that it is completely removed from play to a non-specified area (its not considered to be on the field, deck, graveyard, hand or zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permanently&lt;/strong&gt;: If a card says to do something permanently it means that that action is done for the remainder of the duel, regardless if the card leaves the field or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt;: used in conjunction with Slow or Quick speed, if an effect is Unstoppable it means it cannot be responded by another card, and it cannot be negated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle Swap&lt;/strong&gt;: change the battle position of a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle Lock&lt;/strong&gt;: set the battle position of a monster for a number of turns (if no turn is specified then it&amp;rsquo;s permanent as long as this effect is active). Its controller cannot change its battle position normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-effect-types&#34;&gt;📝 Effect Types
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EQUIP&lt;/strong&gt;: An equip effect is active when this card is equipping another target (usually placed in the backrow unless otherwise stated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATTACH&lt;/strong&gt;: An attach effects is active as long as the card is attached to another card (which means that is placed beneath it in the same zone of the field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DETACH&lt;/strong&gt;: This effect is activated if you manually detach (send to the graveyard) this card while attached to another card (this is a Quick Effect unless otherwise stated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLIP&lt;/strong&gt;: The effect is activated when this card is flipped face-up (either by battle, by an effect or by manually flipping the card face-up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COIN&lt;/strong&gt;: Toss a coin and call it. [O] means you were right on your call while [X] means you were wrong. The card itself specifies if the effect activates when you were right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DICE&lt;/strong&gt;: Roll a six-sided die, if the result matches what is between brackets you must activate that part of the effect. For example [1] means the result is exactly 1, or [2|3] means the result is either 2 or 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRIKE&lt;/strong&gt;: A monster in ATK Position with STRIKE is able to attack a Terrain Marker instead of a monster. The card may add a specific restriction to what kind of Terrain you can activate STRIKE on. You can only activate a STRIKE once per turn during your Main Phase 1 and you skip the Battle Phase that turn. This is still treated as an &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; in game mechanics but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually battle or destroy any monster currently in the attacked terrain unless otherwise stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-idleness-rule&#34;&gt;💤 Idleness Rule
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During your End Phase, if all the following conditions are true then you get one &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Idle Warning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your opponent has at least 1 monster on their side of the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You didn&amp;rsquo;t had at least 1 monster on your side of the field this entire turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t an effect preventing or negating your summons this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already had an &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Idle Warning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; prior to this turn then you lose the Duel by game mechanics instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-clarifications&#34;&gt;☕ Clarifications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;strong&gt;syntax&lt;/strong&gt; clarifications (portraying text of the cards within brackets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{ only on a &amp;ldquo;Rulebook&amp;rdquo; monster } This means a monster that has the word Rulebook in its name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{ only on &amp;ldquo;Rulebook&amp;rdquo; } This means a monster exactly called Rulebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{ only on a Rulebook monster } This would mean that Rulebook is a Monster Type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effects &lt;strong&gt;cannot miss their timing&lt;/strong&gt;. Every &amp;ldquo;Once per Turn&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;strong&gt;hard once per turn&lt;/strong&gt;. Every optional effect that needs to be activated by the player is also a hard once per turn. Every &amp;ldquo;Once per duel&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;strong&gt;hard once per duel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;tribute&lt;/strong&gt; a monster is to send it to the graveyard to fulfil a cost or effect, there are no Tribute Summons in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender Card&lt;/strong&gt; is an informal term used for forfeiting. Placing your hand on top of the deck means you surrender the duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards can be &lt;strong&gt;face-down&lt;/strong&gt; on the field when they are &lt;strong&gt;Set&lt;/strong&gt; (spells and traps) or &lt;strong&gt;Hidden&lt;/strong&gt; (monsters). When you flip a monster face-up you can flip it in either ATK or DEF position. If it&amp;rsquo;s flipped by your opponent it is flipped in the same position it was, unless otherwise stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During regular combat if the attacked monster changed somehow (it went into hiding, changed control, moved, fused, etc.) a &lt;strong&gt;replay&lt;/strong&gt; occurs (meaning the attacking player must choose an attack target again after that first attack was declared).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;take control&lt;/strong&gt; of a card you must place it on your side of the field unless otherwise stated. If it was a monster you also take control of all the equipped cards to it but they remain on their current zones. To &lt;strong&gt;swap control&lt;/strong&gt; refers that a specific player takes control of the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a monster card states that it can &lt;strong&gt;move&lt;/strong&gt; or be moved to another Terrain it always refer to an unoccupied Terrain from the controller of the card unless otherwise stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain cards that can &lt;strong&gt;equip&lt;/strong&gt; things other than monsters like &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Equip the Deck&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Equip the Graveyard&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. In this case the equipping card remains on its zone and is considered to be equipping/targeting that game zone in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional notes for &lt;strong&gt;Equipping&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Attaching&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equipped cards must be placed on the Backrow, while Attached cards must be placed beneath their targeted card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Equip a card you need an effect that allows you to do so or to have that card be of the Equip Type (Equip Spell or Equip Trap).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Attach a card you need an effect that allows you to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a card leaves the field, all other cards equipped to it are destroyed (unless otherwise stated), and all cards attached to it are sent to the Graveyard (unless otherwise stated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional notes for &lt;strong&gt;Hidden&lt;/strong&gt; monsters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden monsters receive Field Power Bonus normally like face-up monsters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t equip or attach cards to a monster that is already Hidden. Cards that were already equipped or attached to a Hidden monster stay face-up on the field though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding a face-up monster is not considered a summon but a game mechanic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing a Hidden monster from your hand is considered a summon unless otherwise stated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-multiplayer-rules&#34;&gt;🤝 Multiplayer Rules
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Team Duel&lt;/strong&gt; is what happens when more than two opposing players take part in a duel. There are three types: Tag Duels, Boss Duels and Battle Royale Duels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between regular duels and Team Duels is that a &lt;strong&gt;Rotation&lt;/strong&gt; of turn order must be defined during the Setup Phase, based on the type of team duel used and the number of players. As a general rule, the Rotation order always iterates between teams first, and then further than teams it iterates between each player of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the last player in the Rotation is allowed to declare an attack in the first round of a Team Duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise stated the life points and gameplay zones (field, graveyard, hand, main deck, extra deck, rule zone) belong to each player and behave like in a regular duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag Duels&lt;/strong&gt; are 2v2 duels of teams fighting each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rotation is: TeamAPlayer1 → TeamBPlayer1 → TeamAPlayer2 → TeamBPlayer2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one player is defeated the whole team is defeated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players in a team have a shared field of 10 Frontrow and 10 Backrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in the shared field each player controls their corresponding zones and cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teammates can reveal some secret information between them in the shared areas (face-down cards) but not in the private areas (like hand and extra deck cards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your teammate can allow you to use their cards during your turn for summoning conditions, but not for attacks, battle position changes or movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boss Duels&lt;/strong&gt; are a &amp;ldquo;one vs many&amp;rdquo; duel, where the &amp;ldquo;many&amp;rdquo; join forces into a team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rotation is: SoloPlayer → TeamPlayer1 → SoloPlayer → TeamPlayer2&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team players share LP and the board (field, graveyard and rule zone) but each still has their own Deck and Extra Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team players collectively control the zones and cards in that side of the field, except the cards in the Rule Zone that are still individually controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team players must also agree to play a single Field Setup card, not one for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle Royale Duels&lt;/strong&gt; are free-for-all duels of 3+ participants without specific allies, everyone is technically considered an opponent here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rotation is: Player1 → Player2 → Player3&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a player is defeated: the rotation adjusts removing that player. Cards owned by that player that are controlled by other players stay in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once per round, a player can redirect an attack that targets a monster controlled by another player to a monster they control (that is able to move), and if it does, the attacking monster cannot be destroyed by that battle and the controller of that attacking monster takes no damage from that battle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A player can allow you to use their cards during your turn for summoning conditions, but not for attacks, battle position changes or movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A player can join a Battle Royale at any point by taking damage equal to half of its starting LP, and inserting themselves as next in the rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After at least one player is defeated, at any point the remaining players can unanimously declare that the duel is over (and they are considered the winners) if they dont want to keep dueling eachother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-deckbuilding&#34;&gt;🔧 Deckbuilding
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each player needs a &lt;strong&gt;Main Deck&lt;/strong&gt; with exactly 30 cards and an &lt;strong&gt;Extra Deck&lt;/strong&gt; with up to 20 cards. Your Main Deck can have Spell Cards, Trap Cards and Normal Monster Cards. Your Extra Deck can have Extra Deck Monster Cards and Rule Cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain cards that have restrictions on  how many of them you are allowed to include in your deck, check the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/restricted-list/&#34; &gt;Restricted List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duelist Setup Rule cards allow you to have in your decks any card listed in its &amp;ldquo;Cardlist&amp;rdquo; (in the quantity it specifies if its more than one) ignoring the Restricted List limitations in deckbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Optional) If you want, you can add one or more Challenge Setup Rule cards to your deck to spice up a bit your deckbuilding skills, but this is entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Additional deckbuilding limitations may be needed depending on the match-up or the players. Kingdom Duels is by nature an unbalance game so feel free to adjust the banlist/restrictions if you feel like it in the interest of a more fair gameplay experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular Yugioh but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000 LP. Starting hand of 5, draw 1 each turn (even in the first turn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Board has 5 monster zones and 5 spell/trap zones. No link/pendulum/field zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule Cards exist (which are Extra Deck cards that change how the game is played).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup Rule cards must be played in the Setup Phase: Your Field Setup define your terrains. You can change up to 2 cards from your starting hand with cards from your Duelist Setup &amp;ldquo;cardlist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terrain Markers exist (they go between the monster zones and the cards). They can give effects and &amp;ldquo;Field Power Bonus&amp;rdquo; to monsters on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can summon normal monsters of any Level without a tribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can play monsters in face-up DEF. You can&amp;rsquo;t Set monsters (you &amp;ldquo;Hide&amp;rdquo; them instead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only Hide monsters in face-down ATK or face-down DEF if an effect lets you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No direct attacks. Can only attack once per battle phase. Attacks can be redirected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of banish there is &amp;ldquo;erode&amp;rdquo; which is a more permanent removal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are repeatedly idle by not playing monsters you&amp;rsquo;ll lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal Spells are usually quick speed (Equip and Continuous are slow speed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traps are (mostly) triggered automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra Deck monsters include: Fusions, Rituals, Alters, Integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are Spell-Trap-Monster combinations and even Divine cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yugioh Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt; is a fanmade project that is the companion of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/about&#34; &gt;Kingdom Duels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; project. It’s a complete re-telling / rewriting of the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime in a sort of bullet point script format that answers the question: &lt;em&gt;“what would have happened if the anime kept going with all the weird rules from Duelist Kingdom instead of the real rules?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is divided into &lt;strong&gt;Chapters&lt;/strong&gt; that represent argumental arcs of the anime series with a different protagonist each time (you can view them as different “anime series” that take place in the same world and continuity, an alternative universe to the one we know). Characters, duels, plot points and entire arcs are changed in this project to tell the same story that we know and love but with a different twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: This chapter follows the same events from the Duel Monster anime but condensed and re-arranged into five major story arcs. It has a bit of original, movie and manga content splashed into it, and some plot points were completely moved around. I attempted to tie in a few missed opportunities, give more relevance to side characters and bring to the limelight the Millennium Items, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: This will be a story about Yugi’s path in those six months between Atem’s departure and the Darkside of Dimensions storyline, on how he encounters new challenges and grows as his own self. It will also reincorporate some things from the original Toei series and some nods to things we wanted to see like Duelist Kingdom v2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: A retelling of the GX anime (just imagine for a second the duel academy professors teaching duelist kingdom rules haha). My OCD compelled me to change the protagonist name to keep up with the “Yu” tradition (sorry). I would aim to make the story a bit more connected while keeping that spirit of freedom and fun that the original one had. The goal is to have a more focused first season and a more conclusive final season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: A retelling of 5D’s, keeping the focus on riding duels and having the original five signers as the main driving force of the show (sorry Crow, you’ll still be here but not as prominent). The mythological aspect of the first half would need to continue a bit more into the second half, and is possible that some manga elements will be added in the middle point of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: A retelling of Zexal (I &amp;amp; II). It will require to transform the alien elements of that show into something a bit more in line with the rest of this setting (astral and barian worlds would need to be changed). Some of the first half of the show would need to be condensed, but the second half is engaging enough to try to keep it as clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: A full rewrite of Arc-V. The largest retelling on scope by far. The core elements will stay (a dimensional war, the bracelet girls, the zarc-ray plot) but there will be a ton of changes. Major differences will include having Yuzu as the main protagonist instead of Yuya; having no legacy characters; having a more focused plan for each dimension; and having a compelling final arc and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: An adaptation of VRAINS, mostly keeping what they told originally but fixing a few things here and there. The Sol chess pieces that were teased during the show will have an arc to them. Side characters will get a bit more time to shine too, with some slice of life elements here and there as i’ll try to tone down the Yusaku-invulnerability due to them not having non-serious duels at all in the original run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small disclaimer is that this is my own take on the yugioh story so take it as that, nothing more, nothing less. It’s essentially a fanfiction that takes advantage of a card variant that we created based on the very first rules of this anime we fans saw as kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each chapter roughly represent an anime series, which is further divided into Story Arcs and Episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script is condensing duels usually to a single episode for convenience rather than to follow a television script format, so duels that took 4 episodes in the real anime are usually condensed into 1 episode here.&lt;/li&gt;

        <guid>https://kingdomduels.com/restricted-list/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A player must follow the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/rules/#-deckbuilding&#34; &gt;Deckbuilding rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while getting ready to play. The &lt;strong&gt;Restricted List&lt;/strong&gt; defines certain restrictions for deckbuilding regarding which unique cards you are allowed to include in your decks, and how many copies of them. A unique card is represented by the card code, not the card name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-forbidden&#34;&gt;⛔ Forbidden
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are not able to include cards from this list in your decks. If a combo is listed it means that you cannot include ALL the combo-pieces together in your decks, but you might include the individual pieces of the combo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[SHH-11] → &lt;strong&gt;Deck Destruction Virus of Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-limited-1&#34;&gt;1️⃣ Limited 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can include up to 1 card from this list in your decks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[SOE-22] → &lt;strong&gt;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CGU-48] → &lt;strong&gt;Force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[SOE-30] → &lt;strong&gt;Head of the Sealed One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[TSC-21] → &lt;strong&gt;Holy Barrier - Mirror Force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[KOD-30] → &lt;strong&gt;Silver-Screen Mirror Wall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-limited-4&#34;&gt;4️⃣ Limited 4
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can include up to 4 different cards from this list in your decks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CHT-27] → &lt;strong&gt;Attack Nullification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[KOD-08] → &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CHT-23] → &lt;strong&gt;Curse of the Hexagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CGU-40] → &lt;strong&gt;Demonic Wind Deity - Hyuga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CGU-41] → &lt;strong&gt;Demonic Thunder Deity - Sanga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[CGU-42] → &lt;strong&gt;Demonic Water Deity - Suga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[SHH-23] → &lt;strong&gt;Emissaries of Reconciliation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[KOD-50] → &lt;strong&gt;Illusion Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[KOD-19] → &lt;strong&gt;Skewer Pitfall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[SOE-25] → &lt;strong&gt;Swords of Revealing Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-surplus&#34;&gt;✅ Surplus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can have more than 1 copy of each of these cards in your deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(You can have up to 3 copies of any card in your decks, unless that card is in the Restricted List.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0021.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 10 Years Anniversary" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 years ago today i started this project with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2qdbv3/ive_been_working_on_a_yugioh_variant_card_game/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a post in the yugioh subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been a decade already! This project was a silly little hobby of mine for a long time, and i loved seeing it grow. From releasing early concepts in 2015 to the current releases past the 2024 rules rework. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it on and off for years, but im honestly really happy to have started it when i did. I want to thank everyone who helped me during this journey. Happy holidays and happy 10 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduces six new terrains: &amp;ldquo;Desert&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cave&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Vortex&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Volcano&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Ruins&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Dragon Valley&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://kingdomduels.com/img/post/post0005.jpg" alt="Featured image of post We have just launched an online Deckbuilder" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/deckbuilder/&#34; &gt;small online browser based app&lt;/a&gt; is now available to help you plan your decks. It has filter options and the possibility to export and import the decks so you can edit them in the future. While not being able to export to Tabletop Simulator at the moment, i think it will be useful for testing ideas or making new decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter by card name, code, card frame, duelist, types or set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left Click on a card to add it to the corresponding Main Deck or Extra Deck (or Token Pile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Click on a card to zoom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export your build to a .json file to save your changes in your own computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the .json file for quick edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview your combined Main Deck + Extra Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your deck to a textfile to use as a reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Museum Arc</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;As normal life returns, the Domino Museum becomes a point of interest for Yugi&amp;rsquo;s other self, who starts uncovering secrets of his past while several chained events happen in that place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My main goal in this arc was to tie multiple short storylines into the city&amp;rsquo;s museum and the egyptian backstory of &amp;ldquo;the other yugi&amp;rdquo;. Having the egyptian exhibition play a larger role here allows me to flesh out more characters like Ishizu and Shadi. A major goal of this arc aswell was to move the virtual arc here, to have it happen before Battle City which will in turn make Battle City flow better without that interruption before the finals. Overall, this whole Museum arc was also a good chance to focus on the side characters for a bit and plant some seeds for upcoming future plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Pegasus Castle, Yugi and his friends are reunited with Bakura and Mokuba. Mr. Crocketts apologizes for Pegasus being absent, and gives Yugi a card called &amp;ldquo;The Ties of Friendship&amp;rdquo; as proof of his championship title, along with the check for the prize, which Yugi gives to Jonouchi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside the castle the gang meet up with Kaiba, who is grateful to see his little brother Mokuba, but warns Yugi they will duel sooner or later. He then leaves toward his helicopter and the guys follow him asking if he can give them a ride to the city, something Mokuba happily agrees. Mai also joins them on the helicopter since she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have another way out of the island.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While flying home, they talk and start to rememorate duels from the tournament and how they got to the island. Jonouchi asks Mai about her first opponents and she briefly mentions the ones she defeated to get 8 stars as boring and uninteresting, with the exception of Jonouchi himself. That said, after her loss to Panik she felt in debt to Yugi so she started really early the following morning, searching duelists all over the island. There were few duelists left, and she assumed a bunch of them had been defeated by the Player Killers that night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a duel arena she found Kajiki and Ryuzaki &lt;strong&gt;dueling&lt;/strong&gt; and decided to watch first and then duel the winner, since they were betting six star chips in total, 3 on each side (Ryuzaki had 3 chips after losing to Jonouchi). Yugi recalls that after he defeated Kajiki that first day Kajiki still had 1 star chip, so he definetely got one or two more wins after that to reach 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the end of that duel, Mai saw three duelists on the beach below them finding some star chips on the sand and screaming in joy about it. Jonouchi and Yugi interrupt her with surprise, saying that those were definetely the star chips Mokuba stole and were thrown into the sea. Kaiba, who was just passively hearing from the front seat, asks Mokuba about that. He admits with regret of stealing the chips from that poor kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi ask Mai to describe those three duelist and when she does, they clearly associate them to the ones they met on the Graveyard Field. Mai saw how those three kept a Star Chip each (that&amp;rsquo;s all they found apparently) and went into a cave near the beach. She followed their tracks, dismissing the Ryuzaki and Kajiki duel for the moment, and once she reached the cave she challenged them. Satake and Takaido ignored her and kept going through the caves, stating that they knew of a shortcut to the castle and that they had business with someone (Anzu assumes they meant Keith for sure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotsuzuka guided her to the Graveyard field, and once in there he revealed that he hid another star chip from the others. Mai &lt;strong&gt;challenged&lt;/strong&gt; him by betting all her 8 star chips for his 2, and defeated him. She then went ahead on the caves searching for the other two duelists and got lost. Halfway through her path she met Kajiki who was searching for her after defeating Ryuzaki. She agreed to duel him but only after they find the other two that fled, since she was thinking that defeating Kajiki and those two will net her with exactly 18 star chips to repay Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They walked through the caves, with Kajiki talking about his father and his duel with Ryuzaki that was a revenge for the japanese tournament, and a bunch of other things that Mai didn’t really cared about. They finally got to the Labyrinth entrance, which they went through just in time to see the Meikyu brothers finishing Takaido and Satake in a duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai teamed up with Kajiki to &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; Mei and Kyu. The two brothers however refused to bet Star Chips. They said that to leave the cave they would need to beat them, but that the time limit for the classification round was near and that the Player Killers were tasked by Pegasus to stall for time since there were less star chips available for duelists at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mai and Kajiki won that hard fought duel, but didn’t get extra star chips for it. They got out of the Labyrinth but the time was running out and there weren’t any more duelist around so the two of them decided to bet all their star chips together and see which would make it to the castle. Mai won the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; and gathered 16 star chips in total. She would then go on to meet the guys and the rest is known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the others then talk about the finals. Bakura is shown quietly looking through the window. They all get to Domino Port in the middle of the night and part ways for now, with Kaiba declaring once again to Yugi that he will duel him at some point pretty soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the following morning, inside Kaiba Corporation headquarters, the Kaiba brothers confront The Big Five for making an alliance with Pegasus and trying to take over their company. However, they manipulate Kaiba into trying his new virtual game, Duel Monsters Quest. All seven go into the virtual world using some special virtual pod machines, but in reality this is their plan B after Pegasus&amp;rsquo; defeat. In secret the Big Five planned to defeat Kaiba in the virtual world using cheats, and have arranged the machine to have the loser of the duel actually lose their mind in the virtual world. By doing that, they would be able to take the company keys that the brothers hold and become the majority shareholder themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virtual world looks real and is brilliantly made. Suddenly, the Big Five change the environment and challenge Kaiba and Mokuba to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. They will be using the Boss Rules for team duels, which means that they would collectively share a board and have their turn iterate with the Kaiba brothers. Even after they stacked their deck to have the perfect initial hand and summoned &amp;ldquo;Five God Dragon&amp;rdquo;, a legendary Fusion monster, Kaiba takes the initiative and with the crucial help of his brother manages to overcome them and win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brothers leave the virtual world. Kaiba, unaware of what just happened to the minds of the Big Five and just seeing all of them unresponsive in their virtual simulator pods, orders his men to remove them from his presence.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day after returning to the city, Yugi goes to the hospital to see his grandfather and hugs him as he is conscious now, his mother is there aswell. Sugoroku is excited about the Egyptian Exhibition that is said to be coming soon to the city (he watched the news about that on the hospital TV early that day) and wants to get in contact with a friend of his, professor Yoshimori.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku is released from the hospital. Yugi and his friends take him home, where they find an American girl waiting for them. She introduces herself as Rebecca, a twelve-year-old prodigy Duelist who is accusing Sugoroku of stealing her &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo;. She demands it back, but the gang and Sugoroku have a problem with this as Seto ripped it up in the first episode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebecca challenges Sugoroku to a Duel for it, but since he just got out of the hospital, Yugi (and not his other-self) takes his place. They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; at the new arena in Kaiba Land. During the Duel, Sugoroku notices Rebecca&amp;rsquo;s Deck and strategy are very similar to an old friend of his named Arthur Hopkins. Rebecca reveals herself to be Arthur&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter, and continues to accuse him of theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku tells the story of how he met Arthur. It was at an archaeological dig in Egypt years ago. Arthur was reading some Egyptian hieroglyphs and noticed they resemble Duel Monsters, making him believe that ancient Egyptians used these monsters in battle for power and control. Unfortunately, no one believed him, but he never gave up on his research. One day, Sugoroku and Arthur were in a tomb when the roof caved in, trapping the two men. There was only enough water for one person, so they decide to &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; for it. In the end, Sugoroku decided to surrender, even though he could have won, because he knew Arthur would need the water more than him. He notices the Duel between Rebecca and Yugi is going in the exact same way as the Duel he had back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, Yugi does surrender. Rebecca demands her &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; card back. Sugoroku reluctantly shows the card to Rebecca, which has been taped together. Rebecca rages out of control upon seeing this as she thinks Sugoroku tore it up. Sugoroku tries to tell Rebecca he would never do such a thing, but Rebecca again won&amp;rsquo;t listen to him. At this point, Arthur arrives and tells Rebecca to behave herself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthur shows Rebecca the top card of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Deck, which was &amp;ldquo;Soul Release&amp;rdquo;, and that it would have allowed Yugi to win the duel. Rebecca is shocked upon finding out about this, but she asks why did Yugi forfeit when he had the chance to win. Arthur explains that Yugi deliberately forfeited to teach Rebecca about the Heart of the Cards and that there is more to life than winning. Rebecca apologizes and to prove their friendship, Yugi gives her the &amp;ldquo;The Ties of Friendship&amp;rdquo; card. Sugoroku talks a bit with his friend, asking him why is he there and Arthur explains that he’s in the city to see the egyptian exhibition on the museum that’s coming up in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthur mention that he got the Blue-Eyes card originally from Pegasus, after he consulted with him in regards to Duel Monsters and egyptology design. He also forgives Sugoroku for what happened with the card.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Back in school we can see Anzu and Honda having a practice &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; that Anzu wins. Honda is getting practice but he is still a total newcomer. Meanwhile Jonouchi is a bit jealous that a new student called Ryuji Otogi is attracting all the girls with dice tricks. Otogi gets Jonouchi involved with one of the tricks, and by playing off of Jonouchi’s gullibility, the trick works. Jonouchi gets angry and he challenges him to a duel. Otogi agrees but only if they duel by drafting new booster packs. They also make a bet, the loser will be the winner’s pet for a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They go to Otogi’s game shop that has a Duel Arena. While getting there a small flashback is shown of Otogi discussing getting revenge against Yugi with an employee of his. He claims that Yugi only defeated Pegasus in Duelist Kingdom by cheating, and plans to expose him to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game shop is full of people. Otogi says that he will broadcast the duel on the screens and they draft the cards. Jonouchi is confident with what he got. Then the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; begins, and after some back and forth Jonouchi makes some big misplays by not knowing or reading properly his cards and Otogi ends up taking the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having won the bet, Otogi orders Jonouchi to put on a dog suit that he got him. Seeing his friend humiliated by Otogi, Yugi gets angry and challenges him to a duel. If he wins, Jonouchi will be released from the deal. Otogi agrees, but says that if he wins, Yugi will swear on his grandfather’s life that he will never play Duel Monsters again and give up his title of “King of Games”.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; begins in a special field called “Dungeon Dice Field” that has some interesting rules that change how the regular duel monster game is played. Yugi has to learn on the go and struggles at first, but eventually is able to pull up a good combo and wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the duel Otogi tells him about how he is the actual inventor of the Dungeon Dice Field along with some other cards, that he started to collaborate with Industrial Illusions as a card designer and that he wanted to push his project forward. He had a contract with them and even met Pegasus himself, but after the Duelist Kingdom tournament was over Pegasus has dropped off the face of the earth. Therefore he had some grudge against Yugi, blaming him for what happened to Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duel, Otogi apologizes for how he treated them and they all end up in good terms. Moments later, his laptop signals a message. He opens the email, and with a thrill, he sees that Industrial Illusions has sent a production contract after all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: Instead of a Dungeon Dice Monster duel they will play a normal duel but with DDM terrain and rules, as a way to mix both ideas. The focus of this project is on Kingdom Duels so its best if we keep everything related to the rules we are creating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Egyptian Exhibition is about to begin in a few days and the Domino Museum staff is hard at work preparing for it. At school, Jonouchi is having a practice &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; with Honda when Yugi tells them about the exhibition and that his grandpa can let them in on the premiere day thanks to him knowing a university professor who works there. They all decide to go (although Jonouchi is scared of mummies), but when he checks the date he says that he might not be able to go with them after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi tells them that he has received the prize money from Industrial Illusions and started the process of scheduling her sisters operation. Shizuka herself is coming to visit him on that very same day when the museum exhibition begins, so he don&amp;rsquo;t think he can go with them. Instead, they all agree to hang out with her instead, regardless of what Jonouchi wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later they meet Shizuka at Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s place, in the morning, and Honda falls for her at first sight. Otogi joins them too this time, after being invited by Yugi and Anzu. They all go to spend the day together, a happy slice of life day. Shizuka is a kind soul and she is proud of her brother, and grateful of him giving her the chance of being able to cure her eyes. She is secretly worried about the operation, and although she says nothing, Anzu picks up on this and comforts her for a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point in the afternoon Yugi tells them that he is leaving to go with his grandpa to the museum for the opening of the exhibition, but they all decide to join him anyway, including Shizuka and Otogi. They arrive and meet Sugoroku waiting for them alongside two other men. They are greeted by professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s friend) and Kanekura (the curator of the museum), who stares at Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle for a bit but says nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They spend the rest of the day there, roaming around the museum while Yoshimori gives them the tour, explaining different egyptian concepts like for example the Weighting of the Feather and the judgment: The crimes that people made would be measured with a scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few important egyptian pieces that will be arriving in a few days, but Yoshimori says that there is also a really interesting collaboration that they are having that week with Kaiba Corporation and their virtual reality pods, that can transport one to a virtual recreation of ancient egypt so they can actually walk and explore that place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interested in the experience, they all go into the pods and jump into the virtual world. They start wandering, surprised by how real everything feels, when suddenly something strange happens and the landscape changes as they fell in what seems like an endless digital pit of green numbers and grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside the pods, in the real world, Yoshimori is worried because the equipment seems to be malfunctioning. Sugoroku attempts to free Yugi but Yoshimori stops him, saying that freeing them now could cause damage in their brains. He wonders how could this be happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group (Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Anzu, Otogi and Shizuka) were exploring an egyptian temple in a virtual reality pod in the museum when they got trapped inside. Arriving to a weird digital-looking place, they are unsure of what is happening, when suddenly a young kid with teal hair shows up in multiple screens in front of them. He presents himself as Noah, and says that they were all invited there as a suggestion of his allies: the Big Five, who show up in multiple screens aswell. They explain who they are, and what happened to them after their duel with Kaiba and Mokuba, when they got trapped in the virtual space forever. They want revenge against Kaiba and are using the oportunity of the virtual reality pods deployed in the museum to trap Yugi, in order to lure Kaiba in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that point Noah speaks directly to the camera, and we see that Kaiba and Mokuba have their own computer screens hacked by this kid. Noah directly confronts Kaiba, challenging to go there and save his so-called enemy as he knows he is in debt to Yugi for defeating Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah then says to the group that he is stealing something from Kaiba for them to use while they are in the virtual world: his new and renovated duel disk that would allow them to have a duel pretty much anywhere. These virtual duel disks would be just a projection, but would still work like the real ones that Kaiba has been developing in secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Big Five then propose a challenge to Yugi and the rest of the group: a Duel Monsters battle within the virtual world. If they win they can get out, but if any of the gang loses a duel to one of The Big Five, the winner will gain control of their body and escape to the real world while the loser&amp;rsquo;s mind will be trapped in the virtual world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have introduced a new set of rules where each duelist has a &amp;ldquo;Deck Master&amp;rdquo;, a special card that acts as a main monster for them. The Big Five make a simple demostration of the rules, explaining that if a Duelist&amp;rsquo;s Deck Master is destroyed then that would mean losing the duel in the spot. To put the odds in their favor, the Big Five declare that they will be dueling anyone currently present before them, not only the duelists, so this includes Honda, Anzu and Shizuka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba is pissed off and tries to hack his way into that server in order to cut off their plans, but Noah declares that it is futile and that the amount of redundancies are countless. He has been planning this for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group protests, specially Jonouchi in defense of his sister, but the Big Five just laugh and splits them all, sending each of them to a different location within the virtual world, as the transmission cuts off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba asks his brother what is he going to do. Kaiba orders Mokuba to stay there while he deals with it. Without wasting much time, he grabs something from a drawer, walks onto the virtual pods within Kaiba Corporation and go into the virtual world despite his brother&amp;rsquo;s protests. Mokuba, after seeing his brother jump in, decides to ignore his order and go in aswell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is dropped through virtual tunnels and ends up isolated in a different place of the virtual world: Yugi arrived to some sort of swamp, Kaiba ended up in a forest, Mokuba in a beach, Jonouchi in the outside of what seems to be a manor, Anzu in a canyon, Honda in a library, Otogi in a fancy hall, and Shizuka near a pond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah sends Oshita from the Big Five to challenge Yugi, but since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a body he takes the form of &amp;ldquo;Deepsea Warrior&amp;rdquo; which will serve as his Deck Master. Once there he challenges Yugi, who first needs to build his deck from a projection of virtual cards. Going through the cards, Yugi is about to choose Dark Magician as his Deck Master but Kuriboh emerges from the card on his own. He protests that he didn&amp;rsquo;t choose that card but Oshita declares that once chosen it cannot be changed, so Yugi decides to trust in Kuriboh who seems happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in the swamp, quickly getting used to the duel disks, and even as Oshita boasts his knowledge of philosophy and warfare to deplete Yugi&amp;rsquo;s reserves, in the end Yugi with the help of Kuriboh manages to win. When he does, a door shows up floating in the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda finds Otogi as they actually were in the same building. They try to get out but the hallways seem to be endless. On a different area, Anzu is being chased by some monsters and falls unconscious.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Anzu wakes up in a cave, having been kidnapped by a group of Cyclops. She discovers they plan on cooking her, but she is rescued when a penguin drops a vine down a hole in the cave ceiling for her. After escaping, the Cyclops chase her over a wooden bridge, which collapses under their weight. The giants fall to their deaths while Anzu barely holds on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Honda and Otogi have managed to break free from that place by using axes and maces to destroy the hallway. They emerge outside where they find Shizuka running from a dangerous beast, and they manage to save her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mokuba wanders in the beach and finds a working TV in the middle of the sand that is still on. It shows his brother walking through the forest. Suddenly a door shows up in front of Kaiba, who opens it and finds himself in a vivid picture of the orphanage that he and Mokuba used to live in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu stands up and finds the penguin that saved her, who leads her to a raft which takes her to a beach filled with more penguins. One of them in particular can speak, and reveals to be Otaki, another of the Big Five, in the form of &amp;ldquo;Nightmare Penguin&amp;rdquo;. He challenges her to a duel in the icy environment, and when she rans away she ends up trapped in a block of ice surrounded by water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anzu gets to build her deck and choose her deck master, and he choses Fire Sorcerer to be the one. As they &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in there, he seems to get the advantage and as he deals damage to her she starts to become encased in ice. Pulling her last strength, Anzu manages to turn around the duel in the end and win, marking a second victory over the Big Five members.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Noah is shown watching in multiple screens where everyone is. He lures Kaiba into the orphanage and displays a projection of his life there, while Mokuba watches on that TV in the sands. They watch the day that Kaiba challenged Gozaburo to a chess match and won. Gozaburo had agreed to adopt the brother if he lost. The scene changes and this time it is showing their life with Gozaburo. Kaiba was forced to overwork in his studies. When his toys were taken away, Mokuba saved his Duel Monsters cards and tried to cheer him up by sneaking them to him along with a drawing of a &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; card. In the present day, Noah mocks the brothers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Yugi has found Anzu and they go through some door that appeared in the middle of the icy tundra. On a different area, Honda, Otogi and Shizuka walk through another of those doors and find themselves in a big hangar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi has wandered around the manor for a long time and is getting angry. He bumps into a door and finds himself in a courtroom, with the next member of the Big Five waiting for him. It is Ooka, taking the form of &amp;ldquo;Judge Man&amp;rdquo;. Jonouchi builds his deck and picks &amp;ldquo;Flame Swordsman&amp;rdquo; as his Deck master. They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; and Jonouchi uses a lot of dice-related cards in order to try to push his advantage, but he keeps failing every coin toss. Yugi and Anzu manage to get there in the middle of the duel, and they cheer for their friend. Suddenly Noah actually appears and declare that the duel is invalid as Ooka has been cheating, he says that he will just eliminate Ooka but Jonouchi stops him and wins the duel despite the cheating.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Kaiba (and Mokuba) are still seeing the scenes from the past. Seto wonders who this kid actually is, why is he so obssessed with him and surpassing him, and who may be behind all of this, as he doesn&amp;rsquo;t think that Noah is capable of pulling a plan like this on his own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honda and the other two find the next member of the Big Five waiting for them in the hangar they just appeared into. It is Ota in the form of his &amp;ldquo;Machine Sergeant&amp;rdquo; Deck Master. He plans to duel Shizuka, but Honda and Otogi (knowing her inexperience with dueling) negotiate with him and agree to a 3v1 &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They build their decks and pick their respective Deck Masters (Raremetal Knight for Honda,&lt;br&gt;
Swift-Strike Black Ninja for Otogi and Goddess of the Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye for Shizuka). During the duel she makes a lot of mistakes that Ota takes advantage of, and while Honda and Otogi try to cover for her it ends up leading to a really difficult decision. Making the ultimate move, Honda sacrifices his Deck Master to save her, but that means that he has lost the duel. The duel then continues in a 2v1. Devastated by this, Shizuka ends up gathering enough courage to get an advantage and, together with Otogi, avenge Honda by defeating Ota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the duel was happening, Jonouchi, Yugi and Anzu had been walking through a cave looking for them. They finally manage to arrive and cheer Shizuka in her final turn. The duel ends with a bittersweet victory, because Honda has been defeated and thus has lost his body to the Big Five.&lt;/li&gt;

Suddenly, Ota in Honda&amp;rsquo;s body shows up and attacks Seto with a steel bar, but he is stopped by monkey-Honda. He escapes in a motorcycle and Seto pursues him in another one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though monkey-Honda cannot speak, Shizuka picks him up and convince the others to take him with them as he helped Kaiba. They try to follow Kaiba and find a pickup truck. At some point monkey-Honda flips a switch on his head that allows him to speak normally, but Jonouchi and Otogi dont trust him yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba is stopped by Daimon on the road, crashing his motorbike, and the two of them begin a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. Like his associates, Daimon is in the form of his Deck Master, but he has disguised it with clothes, a hat, and sunglasses. Kaiba does not attempt to learn his identity, and only when Leichter uses his ability to destroy Trap Cards, it is revealed to be &amp;ldquo;Jinzo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Mokuba finds himself in an unfamiliar room. The TV in the sand disappeared and everything was replaced with what he sees now. Noah is in that room, they talk for a bit and they both watch Seto&amp;rsquo;s duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During their duel, Daimon reveal how Kaiba managed to end up being who he is, and some of the things he did to become the chairman of Kaiba Corporation. Kaiba declares that he is going to purge the Big Five once and for all, and with a display of pure strength he pulls off the win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Kaiba defeats Daimon, he runs off in search of Mokuba now that he knows he is there. Yugi and Anzu run after him while the rest of the gang are stuck behind with the pickup truck. Following the cries of a baby, they find themselves inside a manor a framed portait of Noah posing with Gozaburo. Another door takes them to a projection revealing that Noah is Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s son, and he originally planned to adopt Seto in order to motivate Noah in his studies. Yugi gives Kaiba the portrait of Noah and Gozaburo, who disregards the entire story as false because the photo was dated six years previously, but Noah has not aged since then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Noah&amp;rsquo;s place, Mokuba tries to reason with him, believing that he is the son of Gozaburo and therefore like a brother to him. Noah is not interested in him that much, but Mokuba challenges him to a duel in order to make his feelings reach him. He is no match for Noah and is defeated, but Noah ends the duel with a pensive look on his face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Oshita, Otaki, Ooka and Daimon chase the rest of the gang in an attempt to forcefully steal their bodies. Joey summons five monsters to stall them and they attempt to escape in the truck. After a harrowing chase, Noah rescues the gang from The Big Five since stealing their bodies by force is against his rules. Kaiba keeps going in search of Mokuba and Yugi and Anzu are reunited with the others shortly afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah speaks with The Big Five. Ota is ready to leave the Virtual World in Honda&amp;rsquo;s body, but the rest are in danger of dismissal for their failures. They beg Noah for one more chance. Noah gives them their opportunity, and as their final chance for escape, the Big Five challenge Yugi and his friends, each one of them taking turns speaking through Honda&amp;rsquo;s body and bringing their Deck Masters in rotation. If Yugi and his friends win, they will give Honda&amp;rsquo;s body back. If the Big Five win they will keep all their bodies. They plan to take advantage of the inexperience of the others to be a burden to Yugi&amp;rsquo;s duelist capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; begins and is going back and forth, but in the end a great combination of the gang manages to break the enemy and take the win, or so it seems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Kaiba has reached Noah and demands for him to return Mokuba, who is nowhere to be seen. He then finds out about Noah&amp;rsquo;s funeral.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After they lose, the Big Five cheat to stay alive and make an impossible field against yugi in a &lt;strong&gt;new duel&lt;/strong&gt;, declaring that with him gone the rest would stand no chance later. Noah has detected this and teleports himself and Kaiba to the duel to stop them, but Kaiba is pissed off and stops him in his tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He joins the duel in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s team, suffering a intrusion penalty. Together, they face Five God Dragon and this time they destroy it for good by bringing Dragon Master Knight, a legendary combination of their strongest monsters. Noah permanently deletes the Big Five for cheaters after this, and Honda is left devastated thinking that he will never get his body back.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah teleports Kaiba and the rest to a volcanic area and the two of them start their most anticipated &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. At one point, Noah shows a sphere in the sky to Kaiba, revealing that it contains a digitized version of his brain and has kept him alive in virtual reality after he died in a car accident six years previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah reveals that when his mind was digitized, he was able to rapidly gain knowledge from Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s computer database until he was more intelligent than any human. A flashback reveals that when Noah first existed in virtual reality, he was often visited by his father, who gave him a town to live in and people to interact with. Noah soon grew frustrated with the limitations of the world so he began to reprogram it. He told Gozaburo his idea of improving the virtual world by connecting it to networks around the real world. When he asked Gozaburo if he was capable of taking over Kaiba Corporation, Gozaburo refused to discuss it. Without Noah&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, he started to focus more on the newly adopted Seto and Mokuba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a hard fought duel, Kaiba manages to find an opening and defeats Noah.&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah realizes that he&amp;rsquo;d lost because Seto has the courage to never give up, even when the situation seemed hopeless. Left alone in the Virtual World for six years after his accident, Noah felt that his father, Gozaburo, forgot him upon Seto&amp;rsquo;s arrival into the Kaiba family. Because of this, he blames his stepbrother for robbing him of his birthright of ownership of the family company, and he intended to take revenge by escaping to the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moments later, Gozaburo Kaiba reveals his own virtual self to Noah and the gang and explains the story behind Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s adoption: initially, Kaiba was to become a replacement body for Noah&amp;rsquo;s digitized mind, but Gozaburo later determined that Seto&amp;rsquo;s mind was perfectly good and realized that even though Noah would have a body, his son would never truly grow up and would always remain a spoiled brat in spirit. Gozaburo turned his attention toward training Kaiba into becoming the businessman who would someday inherit Kaiba Corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s takeover of the company ruined Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s plans. Humiliated, he uploaded his own mind into Noah&amp;rsquo;s virtual world and was never seen in the real world again. As the mastermind behind the events drawing Kaiba and the gang to the virutal world, Gozaburo unveils his new plan: to trap everyone&amp;rsquo;s minds in the real world into Virtual Reality using the global networking idea that Noah had conceived six years previously. In being uploaded to the virtual world, the population of Earth would essentially become immortal, and Gozaburo would be the powerful ruler of the new world. Noah realizes for the first time that, although Gozaburo promised to help him claim his birthright when he uploaded his own mind to the virtual world, he was actually just using Noah and The Big Five all along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah leads everyone to a door which he claims is the exit. Instead of entering the real world, they each become trapped in their memories until they realize they&amp;rsquo;ve been tricked and return to a virtual Domino City. Noah teleports away and takes Mokuba to the virtual Domino City arcade where the real exit is. He takes possession of Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body (given that he defeated him before) and escapes to the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing right through Noah&amp;rsquo;s mind games, Kaiba heads through the streets of Gozaburo&amp;rsquo;s virtual Domino City for Kaiba Corporation and finds his biological father in the President&amp;rsquo;s office. He orders Gozaburo to shut down this virtual world and release everyone, but he replies that Seto must earn his freedom and challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;. To remind his adoptive son of the painful moment he&amp;rsquo;d experienced when he dueled Yugi, who&amp;rsquo;d achieved the impossible by summoning Exodia in their first duel, Gozaburo reveals that he is using an Exodia Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Yugi and his friends are fighting an army of duel monsters. Noah has escaped to the real world in Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body and moves towards Seto&amp;rsquo;s pod, planning to unplug it right and there to kill him. But he suddenly has a change of heart when he remembers the way Mokuba considered Noah his brother during their duel, despite the way he had been treated. Noah rushes back to try to help everyone escape, pointing to the location of the exit door, as the duel monsters keep spawning and start to become an insurmountable threat to the gang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group manage to escape to the real world thanks to Noah, and luckily Honda wakes up in his real body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba wins his duel, and when Gozaburo turns into a red monster and tries to escape in Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s body by force, he activates a small device he has brought with him to this virtual world, one that starts to delete everything from the inside. Noah, in Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body, climbs back inside the pod and reenters the virtual world. He returns his body back to Mokuba and the two say goodbye as Noah sends Mokuba back to the real world. Noah then traps Gozaburo, saving Seto, and as the place selfdestructs, Kaiba makes his escape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back at the museum the group gets out of the pods and find that Rebecca and her grandfather are also there. Sugoroku had called them in after the machines malfunctioned. Rebecca, a genius with computers, was able to eventually monitor them inside the virtual world and was trying to find a way for them to exit safely but they beat her to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s friend who works at the museum) ensures that the room is locked out from other visitors and states that they will need to get in contact with Kaiba Corporation to ensure it is safe before opening it to the public. Suddenly, Mokuba himself gets in contact with him on the phone and says that they will be taking the pods out of there for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all start talking about what happened in the virtual world with Rebecca and the others. After a while, Arthur explains that he actually came to the city to see this exhibition in the first place, to which Yoshimori replies that he considers it a great honor given that Arthur is a world renowned archaeologist, known for being the one who discovered a year ago what is rumoured to be Atlantis (a claim that is still in dispute, but impressive nonetheless). Yoshimori also mentions that Ms. Ishizu will be coming soon to the city with some really important pieces of the exhibition, and that they should not miss a second visit once she arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Kanekura (the curator of the museum) is shown to be interested in the Millennium Puzzle and is watching them from afar with another man. The man thinks the Millennium Puzzle looks great and wants to buy it, Kanekura whispers to the man that they&amp;rsquo;ll do business in his office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A man (Shadi) is shown walking through the city, invisible and intangible. A bit of a flashback is shown from him, and an internal monolog about him seeing Pegasus in a coma on a hospital bed, with his Millennium Eye removed, and completely unresponsive. He regrets failing to find his attacker. He arrives at the museum and at the very same moment that group is walking outside, thanking Yoshimori for the visit and saying goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadi (invisible to all) sees Yugi and his Millennium Puzzle in the distance and believes that&amp;rsquo;s fate that they have met there once again. But first he has something else to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kanekura is in his office when suddenly Shadi shows up and judges him with the Millennium Scale. They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in a mind puzzle game, a Shadow Game, and Shadi finds him guilty of greed, evil thoughts and attempting to cash on egyptian relics, the judgment is death.&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following day after school, on the TV, Sugoroku and Yugi hear about reporters on the museum talking about the curator&amp;rsquo;s death. They say it was apparently a heart attack but people are already talking about an egyptian curse. Sugoroku wants to go see Yoshimori at the University since this must be hard for him, but he can&amp;rsquo;t close his store just yet because he is waiting an important delivery of games, so he asks Yugi if he can go see him now that the school is over. He says that he will join him later as soon as he can receive the delivery. Sugoroku calls Yoshimori to let him know in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi leaves the store and bumps into Anzu and Jonouchi who have just heard the news of Kanekura&amp;rsquo;s death. Jonouchi is certain this is a curse and wants to go with them to see Yoshimori since the Professor was nice to them the other day and they are all worried about him. They quickly call Honda but he is stuck at school with club activities so he apologizes he can’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Shadi shows up to Yoshimori at his office and uses his Millennium Key (also known as Millennium Ankh) to look into his mind before judging him with the Scales. In his mind he sees that his heart is cluttered with obsessions from the past and that he neglected his family for his job. He also briefly sees Yoshimori’s brother dying by falling out of a window. The darkness of the room represents the anxiety and fear of death given the recent events, but he also sees hope. That hope is represented by Sugoroku and the group going there. Shadi is once again surprised to see Yugi present and decides that before killing this man he will use him to properly test Yugi, as he will face harder challenges in the future, specially from the one who stole the millennium eye and is still on the loose. Shadi redecorates Yoshimori&amp;rsquo;s soul room, turning him into a zombie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi, Jonouchi and Anzu get to the University and meet with Yoshimori but he starts attacking them. Yugi is surprised to see Shadi appear in the professor’s office but he seems to be the only one who can see him. When it looks like Jonouchi is overpowering Yoshimori, Shadi brainwash Anzu and makes her go running to the roof. Yugi runs after her but cant catch her. When he gets to the roof she is already on the trap Shadi made for her, so they both &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in their minds with the power of their millennium items, while still being aware of their surroundings in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Jonouchi escapes through a window from the demented professor and climbs up, where he sees Anzu. He tries to save her and they do it when Yugi defeats Shadi and the ankh clears Anzu mind. The professor climbed through the window after Jonouchi but the boy places the Ankh upon him and he is too released from the soul&amp;rsquo;s redecoration, coming back to himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defeated, Shadi leaves and mutters to himself that he is now sure without a doubt not only that Yugi is the proper holder of the Millennium Puzzle, but that he is stronger than what he initially thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all go back to the professor&amp;rsquo;s office and after being sure that he is okay they go to the university&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria to buy something to eat or drink, while the professor stays on his office resting for a bit from the crazy incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking advantage that Yugi and his friends are temporarily absent, Shadi appears once again and tells Yoshimori that he still needs to be &lt;strong&gt;judged&lt;/strong&gt;, rising the scales upon him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku is walking down the street, finally getting to the University building when there is a sound of glass shattering. He sees his friend Yoshimori falling through the window and screams in horror. Shadi looks to the professor in the ground one last time and leaves, disappearing in the air. The silhouette of a young girl is shown in the door behind where Shadi just was, covering her mouth in horror after seeing what just happened there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group visit Yoshimori at the hospital and meet his wife, young son and niece. The niece, who is the same girl that saw what Shadi did to his uncle, and goes by the name of Fizdis, stares at Yugi&amp;rsquo;s millennium puzzle but says nothing. Yoshimori is out of danger but he is in a coma and he may never wake up. While leaving, Yugi wonders why Shadi&amp;rsquo;s method are so drastic and is unsure if its friend or foe, convinced that it was him who attacked Yoshimori when they were absent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of days later Ishizu arrives to the city and starts making the final preparations for her egyptian exhibition. Shortly after she gives a press conference on TV about the museum, while also briefly mentioning the unfortunate events that occured there recently. She hopes for the best recovery for the professor and also encourage people to come visit, as its a one-in-a-lifetime experience to see all these relics for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shown walking on the streets. Anzu sees and calls him but he doesnt hear her. She stumbles upon a store with tv screens that is transmitting Ishizu&amp;rsquo;s conference, and is interested in her. Mokuba is also watching the conference in his place too, and mentions it to Seto, who doesnt care. At that very moment Ishizu herself personally calls Seto on the phone and invites him to meet with her at the Museum, with the promise of finding some rare cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba and Ishizu meet at the Museum at night and she shows him an interesting tablet which surprises him. Ishizu uses the powers of her Millennium Necklace (also known as Millennium Tauk) to show him a vision of the past, of Ancient Egypt and of a &lt;strong&gt;battle&lt;/strong&gt; between a priest and a servant of the Pharaoh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She then talks about the Ghouls and the God Cards, explaining what they are and what’s her true goal in the city. She gives Kaiba “The Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk” and instructs him on creating a tournament so that the other two Egyptian Gods can be found. She also states she will entrust Kaiba with &amp;ldquo;Obelisk&amp;rdquo; for the tournament but that he will give it to her back. When he asks why would she trusts him that much she just says that she does. Kaiba leaves the place not caring that much for the egyptian stuff, but laughing about having obtained such a powerful card and getting excited about the prospect of the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi has exchanged the brown rope for a chain in order to keep his Millennium Puzzle as safe as possible. His other self explains that this change is vital since the Millennium Puzzle connects the two, and he also senses that fate has more in store for them, specially after Shadi&amp;rsquo;s recent moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later that day Yugi and Anzu come across a fortune teller who Yugi believes can help him see what is in the future for him. The fortune teller asks for a personal item and suggest the Millennium Puzzle which, once in hand, he steals it. Yugi runs after him and Anzu go asking for help. She runs into Bakura and explain the situation, and then keeps running looking for Jonouchi and Honda. Bakura (once alone) uses his Millennium Ring to look after the Millennium Puzzle saying that Yugi must be the one that holds the puzzle, and that anyone who makes themselves his enemy become Bakura’s enemy as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi follows some arrows on the walls in the street and catches to the fortune teller in an old building that unexpectedly has a Duel Ring in it. The Millennium Puzzle has been locked to the duel ring and the fortune teller challenges Yugi to a duel. Even if they are apart Yugi and the other Yugi (that resides in the Puzzle) can still comunicate, but he says that he must not use the power of the puzzle since he feels that there is something strange, someone else besides this man trying to find his true identity. Yugi must have this duel alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Bakura found the track and starts swapping the arrow signs to confuse anyone else following him. The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; starts, and Yugi notices that the fortune teller has a lot of machine cards. He guesses that he is Bandit Keith, and is right, but Keith is now the host of someone else that is controlling his mind: Marik Ishtar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Anzu finds Honda and Jonouchi and they go searching for Yugi but get confused by the arrows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura watches the duel for a bit and senses that another millennium item is in play. He uses his ring to break Marik’s control. Keith is free for a moment and resists when Marik’s tries to regain control of him. Marik feels that his power is decreasing with every moment. Keith believes that all of this is because of the millennium puzzle so he smashes it to pieces. Bakura jumps and knocks Keith out. He and Yugi gather the millennium pieces and Bakura uses his power to seal a part of himself inside a piece of the puzzle. He then leaves lying that he’ll try to find Anzu and the rest to tell them that Yugi is safe, in reality his mission was completed when he manipulated the puzzle so he has no interest in searching for the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi stays a while because he can’t pull the puzzle out of the arena. Suddenly, Keith wakes up and when Marik tries to control his mind again (with some of the small control he still has, that is still rapidly dwindling) he starts smashing everything around him, knocking some fuel and starting a fire. Yugi tries to get the Puzzle out but he cant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fire is extending quickly and Jonouchi and the rest see the smoke from a distance and follow it to the building. Anzu goes asking for help once again and Jonouchi and Honda brute force the entry. Keith runs past them escaping from the fire. They find Yugi meddling with the puzzle pieces and actually completing it once again before passing out. They try to get the puzzle out and cant, but they hear the voice of the other yugi suggesting to pull the chain with the pipes and they do, saving Yugi and the puzzle from the fire, just as firefighters arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, Yugi is shown on a hospital bed recovering from the fire and talking with his friends about the puzzle. Anzu goes to bring the others a drink and ponders about the existence of the other Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later, at school, Jonouchi triumphally &lt;strong&gt;defeats&lt;/strong&gt; Otogi with his own deck and makes a little dance. Yugi asks Otogi about his contact with Pegasus, and he tells him that he is in contact with a representant, not Pegasus directly, but everything appears to be going well. The game is expanding worldwide and there are multiple companies making contracts to create their own cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shown at home at night, with the puzzle, pondering about what happened with Keith. He talks with his other self about it. At the same time Anzu falls sleep on her desks and has a dream about the other Yugi in an egyptian building, before waking up startled. Back to Yugi, he asks his other self who he is and they both talk about it. Yugi doesnt want to part ways with him though, and cries a bit about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following day, Honda and Jonouchi are at school talking about the upcoming Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s operation. Yugi asks Anzu if she is free that weekend to hang out with the other Yugi, and he sets the date for that sunday at domino station at 10 in the morning as he runs into the rain covering his head with his school bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tricked by his other half, the other Yugi is a bit awkward at first but then he relax and spends a fun day with Anzu. At one point, while drinking something, she asks if he wants to go to the egyptian museum now that it has all the stuff they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see before. He is a bit reticent to this at first. They hang out the entire day, go to the park, see a movie, and buy some card packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They end up meeting a guy named Johnny Steps on a dance video machine and Anzu beats him dancing. He then goes after them and challenge them in “a real game”: duel monsters. Yugi is ready to accept but Anzu accepts for him, saying that she has been practicing a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; and yugi is surprised to see that Anzu holds her up pretty well against him, specially seeing that he’s not a bad duelist at all. At one point she takes a considerable advantage and is about to beat him, so she thanks Yugi for an encouraging comment he gave her. Hearing his name and finally figuring out his looks, Johnny realizes who he is and bails from the duel. But Anzu stops him when he&amp;rsquo;s running away and talks a bit with him, helping reignite his dream on being a dancer and motivating him to keep pushing for his dream and not give up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing that and seeing how she dueled, the other Yugi says that he is ready to see what the Museum may hold for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The night has fallen. Anzu and Yugi go into the Museum and find the old stone tablet depicting a battle between a Pharaoh and a high-ranking Priest: One looks like Yugi while the other looks like Kaiba. They meet Ishizu who gives Yugi some clues about his past. She tells Yugi that, he came to the Museum of his own will and, in doing so, has chosen the &amp;ldquo;Fate of Fighting&amp;rdquo;. If he wants to get his memories back, there&amp;rsquo;s no other choice but to gather the 7 Millennium Items. Yugi, suspicious, questions on which side is she.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She challenges him to a mental &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; using her Millennium Necklace. They have a short mind duel, while Anzu is unaware of what is happening, as the time for them goes way faster because they are dueling with their minds. Ishizu makes some impressive moves on her turn, but quickly surrenders after that, explaining that she has seen how this duel would play out. She calmly replies that she isn&amp;rsquo;t Yugi’s foe, but that she can see a man wielding a new Millennium Item who will show up soon enough in front of Yugi. She adds that Yugi’s battle is for the sake of gaining his memories back and that his Fate will be set in motion soon enough. The rest is for Yugi to confirm with his own eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She briefly uses the power of her Millennium Necklace to give both Yugi and Anzu a small vision (much shorter than Kaiba), but in this case a vision of the future: of Yugi fighting a dangerous opponent, and of the millennium rod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu excuses herself after this, and leaves for the moment. She has an internal monolog about how relieved she feels on finally finding the one her family was looking for so long, but also concerned about what will happen next, now that fate is in motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-64---this-city-will-become-battle-city&#34;&gt;Episode 64 - This City will Become Battle City!

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in Kaiba Corporation, Kaiba has just tested in a duel against his Duel Computer the new Egyptian God card for the first time and is pleasently surprised by its power when it defeats the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (the duel is not shown, only the ultimate dragon being destroyed and Kaiba laughing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Yugi and Anzu leave the museum they walk around for a bit and meet with Mai in front of the domino station. She has shown up for the announcement for the upcoming tournament (and jokingly teases Anzu for being on a date with Yugi). The three of them talk for a bit and spot around other familiar duelists that are near (including Kajiki, Haga, Ryuzaki and many others). Suddenly Kaiba takes control of every television screen in the city and announces his new Battle City tournament, which will start in exactly one week (the following sunday). An ante rule will be present for the rarest card of each deck, and duelists must have the new Duel Disks to enter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming aware of this tournament, the holder of the Millennium Rod and leader of the Ghouls sends his Rare Hunters out to Duel and win Rare Cards for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following morning after the announcement of Battle City, Bakura appears in front of the Domino Museum. He is being guided by his Millennium Ring which is sensing a millennium item in the proximity. He enters the museum and after walking for a bit sees the ancient stone tablet. Ishizu appears before him and confronts him. Bakura is surprised to know that she’s a millennium item holder, revealing that his host’s father is the actual owner of the museum, much to Ishizu’s surprise. They both face in a mind &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; with their respective millennium items. The duel ends up being relatively even, with no one being able to get past the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly, Shadi shows up and interrupts their mind duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-65---clash-of-the-millennium-items&#34;&gt;Episode 65 - Clash of the Millennium Items!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/img/storyimg/ep0065.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadi has interrupted the duel between Bakura and Ishizu by showing himself and breaking their mental connection. Ishizu is surprised to see him here, and Bakura too. Shadi confronts Bakura accusing him of stealing Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Millennium Eye, which Bakura confirms laughing maniacally and fully retelling them their mind &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; (two duels actually, first on episode 28 that Bakura lost but used his power to erase Pegasus&amp;rsquo; memory of it, and then on episode 40 that bakura won).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also confirms in front of Ishizu that he killed Shadi with his own hands years ago, and that he has no problem facing him now as a ghost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura states that he is searching for all the millennium items, and points that he still needs the Scale and Ankh as well. Him and Shadi &lt;strong&gt;face each other&lt;/strong&gt; in a flash of light with their millennium items (Ankh vs Ring). Ishizu runs away in the middle of the bright light and conceals her presence using the Millennium Tauk, saying that she should use it as little as possible now due to there being such a powerful antagonist near her. After the clash, Shadi vanishes too and Bakura mumbles in frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakura, weakened after those two exchanges, looks into the ancient tablet one final time and retreats saying that he needs to gather strength as he has the feeling something interesting is going to happen in the upcoming days. In his place, the real Bakura recovers control of his own body and wonder what is he doing there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ishizu is last seen leaving the museum, as she doesn’t feel safe there. Shadi is last seen in a different place, admitting that he cannot defeat Bakura as he is now, and looking at the Scales and the Ankh pondering why he can’t extract their full powers against other millennium items holders, wondering if he’s not worthy anymore now that he’s dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yugi and his friends travel to the Duelist Kingdom island and challenge Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters, in order to recover the soul of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My goal with this arc was to recreate it faithfully within the Kingdom Duels ruleset. Therefore, no actual changes were made in the narrative on this particular arc. The 40 episodes are replicated here as precisely as they were in the original japanese run of the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A narrator explains how in Ancient Egypt, when the pyramids were young, ancient Kings played Shadow Games, which erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the world. However a Pharaoh sealed the magic away, imprisoning it in the Millennium Items. Thousands of years later Yugi Muto unlocked the secrets of the Millennium Puzzle infusing him with ancient magical energies. Destiny has chosen Yugi to prevent the return of the Shadow Games, just like the Pharaoh did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Domino High School, Yugi is teaching his friend, Jonouchi, &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to play Duel Monsters, while Honda, Anzu and Bakura watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi takes his friends to see Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s (his grandfather) shop. The old man reveals that he has an ultra rare card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kaiba, a rich kid from school who overheard them talking about it, arrives to the place too and attempts to purchase the card but Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather refuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later that night Kaiba calls Yugi asking him to come retrieve his grandfather as he is not feeling well and needs picking up. Kaiba had sent his employees to grab the old man and drag him to his place, where they &lt;strong&gt;dueled&lt;/strong&gt; and he took his Blue-Eyes card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba welcomes Yugi and his friends at his company and tears apart the card he took from Sugoroku. He explains that he did it because already had 3 Blue-Eyes and didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted for the 4th one to be used against him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku leaves in an ambulance but entrust Yugi his own deck. Anzu uses a marker to draw a smiley face symbol of friendship on everyone&amp;rsquo;s hands. She says that even though the ink will wash away, they will always remember the circle of their friendship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi &lt;strong&gt;confronts&lt;/strong&gt; Kaiba in an epic duel using his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s deck. Yugi is overwhelmed and cornered though, as Kaiba is an excellent duelist. Eventually the protagonist manages to draw the five legendary pieces of Exodia, which allow him to win the duel and cleanse the darkness in Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s heart using the power of his Millennium Puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elsewhere, Pegasus is informed that the uncontested champion Seto Kaiba has been defeated by someone named Yugi. Pegasus smiles and his golden left eye flashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At school Jonouchi is &lt;strong&gt;dueling&lt;/strong&gt; Anzu and is defeated by her quite easily. He still has a ton of room to improve so after a talk with Yugi he decides to ask for Sugoroku to train him into a better duelist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days later the Duel Monster National Tournament is taking place and the group is watching the &lt;strong&gt;finals&lt;/strong&gt; on the TV between Insector Haga and Dinosaur Ryuzaki, a matchup that ends up with Haga&amp;rsquo;s victory. Pegasus J. Crawford, creator of Duel Monsters, hands the trophy to Haga and announces a new tournament of a scale never seen before that will be taking place soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi receives a delivery package in the form of a VHS tape, a gauntlet and some other things from Industrial Illusions, the company creating Duel Monster cards. He watches the VHS which happens to be a message from Pegasus inviting him to the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly everything changes when the Pegasus from the TV freezes time and lures Yugi into a Shadow Game using the power of his Millennium Eye. They have a time-gated &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; of 15 minutes and Yugi is shocked by Pegasus abilities to read his mind. In the end Yugi is about to deliver a final blow but the time limit is up and Pegasus wins. Using his powers, he seals Sugoroku&amp;rsquo;s soul into a card and challenges Yugi to come and recover it by defeating him face to face in the upcoming Duelist Kingdom tournament.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Jonouchi attend the ferry to Duelist Kingdom with Anzu and Honda who are sneaking onboard as well. Jonouchi is excited as the prospect of winning the prize money to pay for his sister Shizuka&amp;rsquo;s eye operation but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t invited to the tournament so he almost get booted by security until Yugi sees him and gives him one of his Star Chips, therefore allowing him to participate according to the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the trip, Yugi and Jonouchi meet Kujaku Mai. Anzu spots Bakura from their school and wonders what is he doing there. Mai kicks Ryuzaki out of his room when she beats him in a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haga, the national champion, meets Yugi and tricks him into letting him see the Exodia pieces. In a surprise twist, he throws them overboard. Jonouchi jumps in the water after them. Yugi jumps in to help Jonouchi when he struggles to keep swimming and Anzu throws a rope ladder for them both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi is upset that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find Yugi&amp;rsquo;s cards. He talks about Shizuka who is going blind and the tournament prize money would pay for an operation to fix her eyesight. The four of them decide look into the sunrise as the island approaches in the distance.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The duelists arrive to the Duelist Kingdom and the tournament starts. Pegasus, the host, reveals that it will take place in the entire island as they have to bet other duelists and collect 10 star chips to qualify to the finals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group starts wandering around and Yugi finds Haga. They begin an all-or-nothing &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; as Yugi wants payoff for what happened to the Exodia cards. It is now revealed that there are Duel Arenas scattered across the island and that the terrains they are placed on give different powerups to different monsters.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi takes up this &lt;strong&gt;challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, and although is outmatched and confused by her aroma tactics, he ends up pulling the shocking win thanks to the Time Wizard card he got from Yugi as a gift during the ferry.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;After finding out that Yugi, the one who beat Kaiba, is among them, Kajiki invites them to eat and later challenges Yugi to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; using his powerful ocean monsters that hide beneath the water. In the end Yugi uses a crazy combination to destroy the moon and recede the tide to win. In good spirits, they all depart on good terms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mokuba challenges Yugi to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; but he is no match and abandons the duel in an attempt to steal some Star Chips from Yugi, trying to get him disqualified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They end up catching him and convincing him to return the stars to their rightfull owner, but when he does it the tournament official, Saruwatari, throws the Star Chips to the ocean and grabs him. Yugi challenge him to a duel and he arranges a duel&amp;hellip; but with a different opponent. It seems that opponent is no other than the spirit of the now-defunct Seto Kaiba.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Somewhere else, the real Kaiba, who was attacked by Pegasus goons and had to flee the scene leaving his Deck behind, manages to get to a hidden Kaiba Corporation computer server. From there he launches an offensive trying to put a stop on Pegasus machinations, who is plotting to get rid of him and take over his company.&lt;/li&gt;

He sends a virus trying to destroy the Blue-Eyes card but is stopped by Pegasus&amp;rsquo; cybersecurity mid-way. Someway, however, his bond with his own card manages to destroy the Blue-Eyes White Dragon used by the fake Kaiba, which gives Yugi a fighting chance. As Pegasus hencheman find Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s location he has to flee the scene once again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the actual &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, Yugi manages to fend-off the attacks with the help of the real Kaiba. The impersonator finally reveals himself as who he actually is and the duel concludes with a clever comeback by Yugi. In the end, Yugi focuses his rage towards Pegasus who is watching everything unfold through a monitor, smiling in anticipation for their upcoming duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the group looks around, Mokuba and Saruwatari are missing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ryuzaki then finds and challenges Jonouchi to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, in which his experience proves to be overbearing for the newbie duelist. As he manages to hold Ryuzaki&amp;rsquo;s attacks, Jonouchi plays a pair of Battleguard cards that are a representation of the bond that he and Honda have, managing to turn the tide of the duel.&lt;/li&gt;

Suddenly Ryuzaki plays his best card, the Red-Eyes Black Dragon, which turns the tide in his favour once again. Feeling confident, Ryuzaki convince Jonouchi to bet their rarest cards in this duel. A miracle play with the Time Wizard is barely enough to give Jonouchi the surprising win and also the Red-Eyes card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When nighttime falls the gang decides to set up camp. They are exhausted and hungry. Suddenly Mai shows up with a sack full of food. They get to talk and know eachother better. Later, Mai goes on a walk nearby and is kidnapped by a large man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the campfire, Bakura (a friend from school) appears and the group welcome him to sit down, asking how he got there to the island and what is he doing there. They get to talk about Duel Monsters and all of them show their favourite cards. Bakura states that he wants a duel with Yugi, not for star chips but just for fun, and suggest that they should all put their favourite cards in Yugi&amp;rsquo;s deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they are about to duel a mysterious power shines on and the Millennium Ring appears at Bakura&amp;rsquo;s neck. Everyone passes out due to his magic. As he reaches for Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle, the-other-Yugi appears and says that if he wants his Puzzle, he has to duel him for it, but if Yugi wins, Bakura must restore the souls of his friends. Bakura accepts, but warns him that this is one game he will not win.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also the first time that the rest of the group sees the two Yugi side by side and interact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end they all manage to work together and defeat the evil spirit inside the Millennium Ring, with the help of the real Bakura that bought enough time to let the-other-Yugi to finish the duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone returns back to normal. Jonouchi, Anzu and Honda thought they had been dreaming the experience. Bakura reveals that his Millennium Ring was a gift from his father who had bought it in Egypt from an unusual looking merchant.&lt;/li&gt;

Yugi &lt;strong&gt;challenges&lt;/strong&gt; Panik betting all his star chips to try to recover the ones Mai lost, and the two duelists enter an arena in which the darkness and the night give the eliminator a huge advantage.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus is in his office talking with the Big Five about their deal to take over Kaiba Corporation, which will require from Pegasus to beat Yugi in a duel to clear Kaiba Corporation&amp;rsquo;s name after Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s defeat at the hands of the young duelist. The Big Five are the board of Kaiba Corporation and want Kaiba removed from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Seto Kaiba arrives in a helicopter to the Duelist Kingdom island in search of Mokuba and encounters Yugi and the group. Yugi returns Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s deck to him (as he had been holding on to it after defeating the impersonator) and Kaiba thanks him. They talk about defeating Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi is angered by Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s attitude and challenges him to a &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, which Kaiba accepts as he wants to try out his new Duel Disk system he&amp;rsquo;s been working on. Jonouchi is no match for Kaiba and gets stomped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiba then tells them about Pegasus&amp;rsquo; mysterious powers. Sometime ago at the United States, Kaiba himself was one of Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s guests of honor in a tournament. In the final round, Pegasus was &lt;strong&gt;dueling&lt;/strong&gt; a man named Bandit Keith. Pegasus just played with Keith, then wrote something on a piece of paper and called a kid from the audience. With that paper the kid managed to beat Keith in a single turn, to Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Kaiba may not agree on most things, but they both know that Pegasus must be stopped. Kaiba leaves the group and heads for the Pegasus&amp;rsquo; castle, unaware that Pegasus is watching him with his Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next morning Anzu shows up with Mai&amp;rsquo;s backpack. Mai left the group, but wrote Yugi a note saying she owes him eight Star Chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the gang walk through the woods, they are being spied on by three boys: Kotsuzuka, Takaido, and Satake, who all work for Bandit Keith. Keith sneaked into the Duelist Kingdom tournament to get revenge on Pegasus for what he did to him in New York City. The three spies know Yugi was the kid who defeated Seto Kaiba months earlier, so they decide to eliminate Jonouchi first. Jonouchi, wanting to go to the bathroom, splits a bit from his group but Takaido and Satake follow him and knock him unconscious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi wakes up in a cave where a Graveyard field is located. In there he begins a spooky &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; against Kotsuzuka and his Zombie monsters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the group find Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s wallet, leading them to investigate a nearby cave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the group have to deal with a number of traps until they finally reach the arena. In there, the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between Jonouchi and Kotsuzuka continues and reaches its climax. After being overwhelmed by the indestructible zombies, Jonouchi manages to swap them into defense and destroy them for good, winning the duel. He now has eight Star Chips, meaning he only needs two more to become a finalist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the group approaches the cave&amp;rsquo;s exit, Keith&amp;rsquo;s gang blocks the entrance with a large boulder, too heavy for any of them to budge. As punishment for losing, Keith beats up his henchmen and takes all of their Star Chips, getting a total of ten. Though this was not what he originally planned, it&amp;rsquo;s still fine by him, and he strides off alone, ready to enter Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the cave, Yugi and the group have no way of removing the boulder blocking the entrance. Suddenly, Bakura&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Ring starts to point into a direction, presumably towards Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following where the ring points, they end up at a large Dueling Arena, where the Meikyu Brothers appear, challenging them to a &lt;strong&gt;tag duel&lt;/strong&gt;. Yugi and Jonouchi bet six Star Chips between them, enough to gain them entrance to Pegasus Castle if they win. But first they must get pass the eliminators and their unique field: the Labyrinth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Mokuba, trapped in Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s underground prison, is thinking about his brother Seto and what happened to them when they were younger. Kaiba, on the other hand, is outside, approaching Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in the labyrinth continues. Yugi and Jonouchi bring out their strongest monsters, but the Meikyu Brothers use clever tactics to traverse the maze and separate their monsters while they unleash all three pieces of their powerful boss monster, the &amp;ldquo;Gate Guardian&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, as Seto Kaiba approaches Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s castle, he is confronted by Saruwatari, but Kaiba overpowers him and takes him hostage, demanding that he take him to Mokuba. Saruwatari takes Kaiba through Pegasus&amp;rsquo; underground prison, but activates an alarm, forcing Kaiba to flee and find Mokuba himself.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi and Jonouchi display really effective teamwork strategies to overcome their opponents and win the &lt;strong&gt;tag duel&lt;/strong&gt;, finally earning enough Star Chips to enter the castle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s dungeon, Kaiba finds Mokuba but is soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to lock Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s soul in a card. He throws some star chips at Kaiba and tells him that if he wants to see Mokuba again, he must defeat Yugi first.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and the group emerge from the underground tunnel and arrive outside Pegasus Castle. Anzu thinks about how Yugi often switches from a gentle and caring nature to a more forceful, slightly colder and unfriendlier one. She concludes there must be two Yugis after remembering his Duel with Bakura.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She then recalls some time ago when she was working part-time at Burger World and she feared that Yugi and Jonouchi would reveal this to the school when they visited one day (as it was against the school rules to have a part-timme job). She admitted she was working there to raise money to travel to New York to study dance, and was shocked to find they were encouraging her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a pervert mugger with a camera, and was knocked out unconscious for a moment. She was rescued by Yugi who challenged the mugger with Duel Monster cards and Mind Crushed him. Although she was a bit hazy she remembered the confident attitude of Yugi at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the group climb up the stairs to Pegasus Castle they encounter Kaiba, who challenges Yugi. Yugi accepts and they begin their &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; on an open area atop the castle using Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s new-and-improved Duel Disks. Bandit Keith arrives at the castle in time to watch, but he stays out of view of the others.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between Kaiba and Yugi continues and Kaiba pulls off a big combo summoning a fusion of his three Blue-Eyes while also destroying Yugi&amp;rsquo;s entire deck. The situation seems hopeless for Yugi, but encouragement from his friends and thoughts of his grandpa make him determined to carry on.&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite being at the mercy of Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s fused dragon, Yugi forms a crazy counter defense while also jeopardizing his opponent monster, turning the tide completely. Kaiba becomes distressed as he knows he is going to lose the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, and the fate of Mokuba is also in the balance for him. Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Elf Swordsman cuts off one of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s head, and another attack will defeat Kaiba.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle battlements. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the force of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him. Kaiba resurrects the dragon head that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi&amp;rsquo;s monster and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move, otherwise he will fall to his death. Yugi and his other self have a conflict over risking Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s life for his grandpa. The-other-Yugi launches the attack anyway, but Anzu runs to him pleading to call off the attack. Yugi regains control of his body and stops the attack just in time. Kaiba then declares an attack and wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is frightened of his other self, who was willing to kill in order to win. He drops to his knees and begins to sob. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi on his weakness, but Anzu tearfully scolds him, saying that he bet his &amp;ldquo;chip of life&amp;rdquo; like it was nothing and that he is the true loser because Yugi was willing to protect Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s own life despite the outcome of the duel. Kaiba leaves, having no comeback to her words.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yugi is shocked about what happened and won&amp;rsquo;t respond to his friends, even when Jonouchi offers his star chips to him. Mai shows up and offer him the Star Chips that she owed him, stating that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find all 8 but she has 6, which would be enough for him to enter the castle. But Yugi has no response. Exasperated, she challenges him to a duel for the chips but Anzu decides to take his place to everyone&amp;rsquo;s shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; does not start off very well for Anzu, as Mai is just more experienced. But at some point Anzu manages to use a combination to destroy Mai&amp;rsquo;s Harpie Lady. Mai was about to activate a response but decides not to, and forfeits the duel after that. Yugi snaps out of it during the duel, seeing Anzu dueling for him. He ends up accepting Mai&amp;rsquo;s Star Chips and everyone heads towards the castle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mr. Crocketts comes in and greets the finalists telling them there will be an exhibition match for them between Seto Kaiba and Pegasus himself. Kaiba wants Pegasus to duel with his Duel Disks but Pegasus says if they use them, the now soul-less Mokuba will operate his for him. Kaiba, not wanting to duel his own little brother, decides to &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; in a normal Dueling Arena instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battle starts and Pegasus uses his power to get a clear advantage of his opponent.&lt;/li&gt;

He unleash his powerful Toon monsters against him, and although Kaiba puts up a valiant fight, in the end he is defeated by a reverse combo in which Pegasus uses Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s own virus card to destroy his entire deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the duel, Pegasus seals Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s soul inside a card. Yugi, both saddened and angry after everything that happened, challenges Pegasus. He responds that if he wish to duel him he has to win the tournament first.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is the evening before the Duelist Kingdom finals and everyone in the castle is having dinner in the dining hall. During the feast, the pairings of Duelists in the Finals are determined. First, Yugi will face Mai, and then Jonouchi will duel Keith. Unfortunately, Jonouchi and Keith do not have either of the required tournament entry cards. Yugi gives his friend the &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Hand&amp;rdquo; entry card for him to use the prize money for his sister&amp;rsquo;s eye operation. Meanwhile, Keith schemes to find another way to get one of the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the dinner, everyone splits and heads to their designated bedrooms. Mai is planning her strategy for the duel. Jonouchi is asleep in his room, dreaming and talking out loud when Keith sneaks in and steals his tournament entry card. Yugi is asleep and has a dream with his grandpa and the Kaiba brothers cards in tombstones, speaking to him asking for his help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda suspects that Pegasus cheated in his duel against Kaiba and brings Anzu and Bakura to inspect the Dueling Arena. They find a hole that shines moonlight directly at the arena. Looking through the hole, Honda sees a tower on the other side of the courtyard and suspects that one of Pegasus&amp;rsquo; henchmen may have being spying on Kaiba&amp;rsquo;s hand using a telescope. The three climb into the tower using a grappling hook. Inside, they inspect the room and find nothing but a painting of a woman. They are soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three wake up in a passageway filled with Egyptian murals and paintings. They enter a room, where two robed men are facing each other while others behind them are chanting. The two robed men reveal stone tablets to each other. One contains a carving of a &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; while the other has a &amp;ldquo;Crawling Dragon&amp;rdquo;. The robed man with &amp;ldquo;Crawling Dragon&amp;rdquo; loses and is consumed in green flames, as his monster was weaker than &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo;. Honda, Anzu and Bakura unintentionally make some noice seeing this, causing the robed men to notice them and surround them. The winning man reveals himself to be Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus reveals that the game he just played was one of the Shadow Games that took place in ancient Egypt, an ancient ritual where one&amp;rsquo;s very being is put to the test. He reads Anzu and Honda&amp;rsquo;s minds, to their shock, and explains what his Millennium Eye can do. When he tries to do the same to Bakura, his Millennium Ring appears and the evil Bakura takes over Bakura&amp;rsquo;s body. Pegasus is absolutely surprised about this. Then, their Millennium Items clash in a powerful beam of light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honda and Anzu appear back in their rooms, feeling that what just had happened was a dream. In his own room, the other Bakura is happy that he has finally found the Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;

Losing her most powerful monster and not willing to watch her Harpie Ladies be destroyed, Mai surrenders.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The second duel of the semifinals between Keith and Jonouchi is about to begin. When Mr. Crocketts asks both contestants to show their tournament entry cards, Keith shows the one he took from Jonouchi. So naturally, when Jonouchi reaches for his, he can&amp;rsquo;t find it. He has five minutes to find that card or he will be disqualified. Jonouchi searches all over his room for it, but to no avail. He is just about to give up when Mai comes in and gives him her card. He arrives at the Dueling Arena just in the nick of time and presents Mai&amp;rsquo;s card, to Keith&amp;rsquo;s shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between them begins, and Keith takes the advantage with his machine monsters which are immune to magic attacks. He is far more experienced and after dealing with some of Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s cards he launches a final attack&amp;hellip; which gets stopped by Jonouchi. The duel then turns into a neck-to-neck battle, proving how much Jonouchi has learned in the island.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; between Jonouchi and Keith remain close until the latter summons Revolver Dragon, which not even Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s Time Wizard combo was able to defeat. He ends up making a crazy move though, summoning his Red-Eyes Black Dragon and using Keith own cards against him. At some point Keith has to actually cheat by pulling cards to his hand in order to re-take the advantage, but even then Jonouchi manages to find a path and deal the finishing blow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keith, refusing to accept defeat, demands the Duel be declared invalid since Joey used Mai&amp;rsquo;s card. Jonouchi admits this is true and asks how he could have known that. Pegasus, at this point declares that Keith stole Jonouchi&amp;rsquo;s card, and that he personally doesn&amp;rsquo;t care much about which card they are holding, but he cannot condone how he cheated during the duel. Pegasus orders his guards to take Keith away, but Keith knocks them out cold, jumps towards Pegasus, and points a gun to his head, demanding the prize money. Pegasus mocks Keith and activates a trap door on the ground, sending Keith through a tunnel and out into the ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Jonouchi being the winner, he now has to face Yugi in the final duel of the tournament to decide the one that will face Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;

This is a really tough &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; for both Duelists, as they are both close friends, but must face each other to get what they want (Yugi the chance to Duel Pegasus and save his grandpa and the Kaiba brothers; Jonouchi the chance to win the prize money needed to pay for his sister eye operation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonouchi starts strong and gets the upper hand, baiting some plays from Yugi and managing to summon Black Demons Dragon fusing monsters from both of them.&lt;/li&gt;

Jonouchi ends up using his Time Wizard to empower his Baby Dragon into Thousand Dragon, but this also triggers Yugi&amp;rsquo;s own Dark Magician who becomes an older and more experienced version of itself. With tears in their eyes, Yugi resurrects Black Demons Dragon to finish the duel. He is the winner of Duelist Kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, Jonouchi tries to give him his &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Right Hand&amp;rdquo;, but Yugi tells him to keep it since Jonouchi needs the money more than he does and Yugi is only there to rescue his grandfather. With the Duel over, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the ultimate showdown between Yugi and Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final Duel of Duelist Kingdom is about to begin. Yugi will face Pegasus for the release of his grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba. The Big Five are watching the Duel, knowing that if Pegasus wins, Kaiba Corporation is his. Before the duel starts, Mr. Crocketts asks Yugi to show the &amp;ldquo;Glory of the King&amp;rsquo;s Left Hand&amp;rdquo; card to challenge the king, which he does. He explains that if he wins he will get 60% of Industrial Illusion&amp;rsquo;s stocks (in other words, if he wishes it, he will become the new president of Industrial Illusions). Pegasus then says that on the other hand, if Yugi loses the duel, he will be trapped in a card like the others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Duel&lt;/strong&gt; does not start off very well for Yugi, as Pegasus is able to read his mind through the use of his Millennium Eye, thereby countering any of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda, believing Pegasus is up to something, runs off to the castle&amp;rsquo;s dungeon to find the bodies of the Kaiba brothers. He wanders around the dungeon until he finds Mokuba. Unfortunately, unlocking his cell door triggered a silent alarm, forcing him to flee while the guards hunt him down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus continues to read Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind in their &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt;, and plays &amp;ldquo;Toon World&amp;rdquo;, turning his monsters into Toon monsters. Yugi knows from Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Duel with Kaiba that this is a very powerful card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Bakura, under the control of his evil self Bakura, leaves the group to search for Honda. He finds him with Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body and being cornered by two guards. Bakura uses &amp;ldquo;Chains of Magical Energy&amp;rdquo; to trap the guards (using some sort of magic to actually use the effect of a card in the real world), allowing him and Tristan to get away. However while trying to escape, they quickly reach a dead end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; continues. Yugi and the-other-Yugi devise a plan to counter Pegasus&amp;rsquo; Millennium Eye by repeatedly switching control of Yugi&amp;rsquo;s body each turn using the Millennium Puzzle. They will not even tell each other what cards they place on the field, making Pegasus unable to figure out their strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Yugi destroys Pegasus&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Toon World&amp;rdquo; and all of his monsters, Pegasus decides to take the duel with the utmost respect and he starts a Shadow Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Honda and Bakura are cornered in the dungeon, but suddenly Bakura uses &amp;ldquo;Flesh-Eating Insect&amp;rdquo; to attack Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s guards, then sending them to the Graveyard with &amp;ldquo;Metamor Pot&amp;rdquo;. Honda realizes that Bakura is really the spirit of the Millennium Ring from before, and Bakura reveals that he wants to use Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body for himself. He threatens Honda, saying that if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t give him up, he will end up like the guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the evil Bakura demands Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body, Honda knocks him out, takes his Millennium Ring, and throws it off the castle into the woods. He then carries Bakura and Mokuba back to the balcony, where Jonouchi and Anzu are witnessing the beginning of the Shadow Duel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact between them and Yugi has been cut off, and they cannot enter the shadow cloud - they either walk straight through it or return where they started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the shadow, the &lt;strong&gt;duel&lt;/strong&gt; continues. The virtual simulation system from Kaiba is not working. Instead, each monster is maintained by one&amp;rsquo;s life energy, and regular Yugi cannot handle the force of the Shadow Game. The-other-Yugi takes over for a time stating that Yugi will not survive in such conditions, but Yugi convinces him to switch back to keep their Mind Shuffle strategy working. He manages to draw and set a card, but when Pegasus destroy&amp;rsquo;s his defending monster Yugi collapses. Despite his other self frantic calls, Yugi seems to be gone. This leaves just the-other-Yugi against Pegasus, who can once again read his mind and know all of his moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The-other-Yugi is on the verge of defeat against Pegasus. He then gets a vision of Sugoroku, who tells him that Yugi may not physically be with him, but his spirit still is. When Pegasus tries to read Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, the card he drew is blocked because of Anzu, Honda and Jonouchi spiritually bonding together to support Yugi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a final epic turn, the-other-Yugi &lt;strong&gt;wins&lt;/strong&gt; with the help of &amp;ldquo;Magician of Black Chaos&amp;rdquo;, a card summoned thanks to the final effort of Yugi himself. Pegasus is left completely shocked at his loss, as the shadow bubble dissipates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi&amp;rsquo;s friends are overjoyed that he is okay and that he finally won the duel, but Anzu quickly reminds everyone that this is not over yet until Pegasus returns Kaiba, Mokuba, and Yugi&amp;rsquo;s grandfather&amp;rsquo;s souls like he promised. Yugi then turns around and is shocked to see that Pegasus has disappeared. Bakura at this point wakes up and calls out to the group. Honda reveals to Bakura that he had to get rid of the Millennium Ring as it was possessing him like before and Bakura thanks him, understanding that getting rid of it was the probably the right thing to do. Bakura then tells the group he&amp;rsquo;ll keep an eye on Mokuba while the others search for Pegasus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After they leave, the Millennium Ring reappears around his neck and the evil Bakura returns. Mokuba&amp;rsquo;s body is no longer of use to Bakura since Pegasus will be returning his soul, but with Pegasus weakened, Yami Bakura states it is the perfect time to take his Millennium Eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having won the tournament, Yugi is now officially the King of Duelists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi and his friends are running through the castle in order to find Pegasus, so that he will release all the souls that he captured like he promised. Anzu stops for a brief moment because she notices a nearby tower. She notes to her friends that she recognizes that tower as the one she thought that Honda and Bakura went up into before in a dream. She then realizes that was Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s sanctuary and what she remembered was real. Honda agrees too as the memory is coming back to him. They decide to go there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus is in his private tower and is depressed that he lost against Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle. Regardless, he is a man of his word, so he releases the souls of Sugoroku and the Kaiba brothers. Because of this all 3 wake up and regain their senses. Just then, the evil Bakura arrives and gives Pegasus an impromptu tarot reading before challenging him to a Shadow Game using their Millennium Items. Bakura easily defeats Pegasus (who&amp;rsquo;s still exhausted from his Shadow Game with Yugi), and takes his Millennium Eye. Yugi and the gang arrive to see Pegasus unconscious being carried away by his guards. They enter the tower and find Pegasus&amp;rsquo;s diary. Anzu reads from it, and it explains that as a teenager, he met a girl named Cyndia. They were true lovers, but just as they were about to be married, Cyndia got sick and died.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus traveled all over the world trying to get her back. He wound up in Egypt, where he met a man named Shadi, who gave him the Millennium Eye. Thanks to his wish asked to the Eye he got a brief vision of her. Pegasus gets the idea that using the holographic technology of Kaiba Corporation along with the power of the Millennium Items could bring Cyndia back to life. He explains in his diary that this was his reason for hosting the Duelist Kingdom tournament, but the diary ends there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi notices that there are three Soul Prison cards that are blank. That means Pegasus did release the souls of his prisoners like he had promised. As the group leaves, Shadi appears in the stairs using magic and confronts Yugi. Shadi uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, as that is the power of his item. To his surprise, he finds two chambers in his mind, one for Yugi, and the other for the-other-Yugi. While the former is a nice room full of innocence and toys, the latter is a giant maze filled with trap doors. Shadi enters through several of them before almost falling into an endless void. Luckily, the regular Yugi saves him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the chambers, Shadi and Yugi are walking alongside stone tablets that feature monsters from the actual Duel Monsters game. The &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; shows up, who is about to attack them as he thinks they are intruders. Shadi plans to use the &amp;ldquo;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&amp;rdquo; tablet below them to destroy it, but Yugi talks him out and manages to convince the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; to let him go. Shadi is shocked that Yugi was able to convince the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; that easily, given that the &amp;ldquo;Dark Magician&amp;rdquo; is it said to be the most loyal of the ancient Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s servants. Shadi leaves Yugi&amp;rsquo;s mind, believing he is the one that will save the world from chaos. Before he leaves, Shadi warns Yugi to take great care as the thief that stole the Millennium Eye will go after Yugi&amp;rsquo;s Millennium Puzzle soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It takes place in a single continuity so all the story chapters are interconnected and can be placed in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/scrolls/timeline/&#34; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore there are different locations around Japan (and beyond) that are also tied to the chapters of the story, listed here:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/yugioh-scrolls&#34; &gt;Yugioh Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; takes place in an alternative universe to the Yugioh manga or anime that we know. This is a timeline of important events in the Yugioh Scrolls project story, not a timeline of the events of the original Yugioh anime or manga. Here, events happened differently in one single big continuity that takes all story chapters into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This timeline contains spoilers for the placements of major events of Yugioh Scrolls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline&#34;&gt;Timeline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horakhty creates the Light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Human world and the Spirit world come into existence together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, human civilization advances beyond prehistorian times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zorc Necrophades is created out of the darkness of people&amp;rsquo;s hearts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1000 B.C.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egypt is under threat. The events leading to the massacre of Kul Elna and the creation of the Millennium Items take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events involving Atem&amp;rsquo;s war against Bakura and Zorc Necrophades takes place. Atem is sealed in the Millennium Puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~1960s&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugoroku Muto goes on an expedition to the Valley of the Kings and finds the Millennium Puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1980&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(June 4th) Yugi Muto is born.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1982&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus in his youth meets Cyndia for the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1989&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyndia passes away due to an illness. Pegasus start searching the world for something to revive her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1990&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pegasus goes to Egypt and receives the Millennium Eye from Shadi. He starts working on Duel Monsters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A young Bakura comes into contact with the Millennium Ring by following his father to the place where Shadi kept it. Bakura unleashes the power of the Millennium Ring and kills Shadi, as the kids from Prana witness the event. Shadi&amp;rsquo;s spirit would endure as a ghost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1991&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one fateful day Marik leaves the gravekeeper&amp;rsquo;s place and sees the outside world for the first time. Shadi&amp;rsquo;s ghost finds Ishizu and Marik and tells them about the incoming resurrection of the Pharaoh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1996&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yugi solves the Millennium Puzzle. Atem resurfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this point onward Duel Monsters become insanely popular and technology advances rapidly thanks to the Solid Vision technology, way faster than in our world. The importance of Duel Monsters skyrockets way beyond a simple game, and a huge world paradigm shift occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 1997 - October 1997 or 1998?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kingdomduels.com/yugioh-scrolls/#the-millennium-chapter&#34; &gt;The Millennium Chapter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 1997 or 1998? - March 1998 or 1999?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2004 - March 2007&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The Academy Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2007 - 2009&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly in parallel, the following events happen at different points in time during these years:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The Signer&amp;rsquo;s Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The Numbers Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The Dimensional Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events of &lt;strong&gt;The Virtual Chapter&lt;/strong&gt; take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
