**Yugioh Scrolls** is a fanmade project that is the companion of the **[Kingdom Duels](/about)** project. It’s a complete re-telling / rewriting of the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime in a sort of bullet point script format that answers the question: *“what would have happened if the anime kept going with all the weird rules from Duelist Kingdom instead of the real rules?”.*

The story is divided into **Chapters** that represent argumental arcs of the anime series with a different protagonist each time (you can view them as different “anime series” that take place in the same world and continuity, an alternative universe to the one we know). Characters, duels, plot points and entire arcs are changed in this project to tell the same story that we know and love but with a different twist.

## The Millennium Chapter

- **Status**: Ongoing. **90/140** episodes.
- **Protagonists**: Yūgi Muto & Pharaoh Atem

</div>

> **Author Notes**: This chapter follows the same events from the Duel Monster anime but condensed and re-arranged into five major story arcs. It has a bit of original, movie and manga content splashed into it, and some plot points were completely moved around. I attempted to tie in a few missed opportunities, give more relevance to side characters and bring to the limelight the Millennium Items, among other things, but always respecting the original vision and plan.

## The King's Chapter

![The King's Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter02.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūgi Muto

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: This will be a story about Yugi’s path in those six months between Atem’s departure and the Darkside of Dimensions storyline, on how he encounters new challenges and grows as his own self. It will also reincorporate some things from the original Toei series and some nods to things we wanted to see like Duelist Kingdom v2.

## The Academy Chapter

![The Academy Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter03.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūdai Yuki

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}

{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: A retelling of the GX anime (just imagine for a second the duel academy professors teaching duelist kingdom rules haha). My OCD compelled me to change the protagonist name to keep up with the “Yu” tradition (sorry). I would aim to make the story a bit more connected while keeping that spirit of freedom and fun that the original one had. The goal is to have a more focused first season and a more conclusive final season.

## The Signer's Chapter

![The Signer's Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter04.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūsei Fudo

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: A retelling of 5D’s, keeping the focus on riding duels and having the original five signers as the main driving force of the show (sorry Crow, you’ll still be here but not as prominent). The mythological aspect of the first half would need to continue a bit more into the second half, and is possible that some manga elements will be added in the middle point of this story.

## The Numbers Chapter

![The Numbers Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter05.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūma Tsukumo

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}

{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: A retelling of Zexal (I & II). It will require to transform the alien elements of that show into something a bit more in line with the rest of this setting (astral and barian worlds would need to be changed). Some of the first half of the show would need to be condensed, but the second half is engaging enough to try to keep it as clean as possible.

## The Dimensional Chapter

![The Dimensional Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter06.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūzu Hiiragi

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: A full rewrite of Arc-V. The largest retelling on scope by far. The core elements will stay (a dimensional war, the bracelet girls, the zarc-ray plot) but there will be a ton of changes. Major differences will include having Yuzu as the main protagonist instead of Yuya; having no legacy characters; having a more focused plan for each dimension; and having a compelling final arc and resolution.

## The Virtual Chapter

![The Virtual Chapter](/img/storyimg/Chapter07.jpg)

- **Status**: Pre-Planning Stage
- **Protagonist**: Yūsaku Fujiki

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
{{< imagetext src="/img/storyimg/00.png" alt="?" width="140" >}}
</div>

> **Author Notes**: An adaptation of VRAINS, mostly keeping what they told originally but fixing a few things here and there. The Sol chess pieces that were teased during the show will have an arc to them. Side characters will get a bit more time to shine too, with some slice of life elements here and there as i’ll try to tone down the Yusaku-invulnerability due to them not having non-serious duels at all in the original run.

## Notes

- A small disclaimer is that this is my own take on the yugioh story so take it as that, nothing more, nothing less. It’s essentially a fanfiction that takes advantage of a card variant that we created based on the very first rules of this anime we fans saw as kids.
- Each chapter roughly represent an anime series, which is further divided into Story Arcs and Episodes. 
- The script is condensing duels usually to a single episode for convenience rather than to follow a television script format, so duels that took 4 episodes in the real anime are usually condensed into 1 episode here.
