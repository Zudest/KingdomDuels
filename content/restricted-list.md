A player must follow the **[Deckbuilding rules](/rules/#-deckbuilding)** while getting ready to play. The **Restricted List** defines certain restrictions for deckbuilding regarding which unique cards you are allowed to include in your decks, and how many copies of them. A unique card is represented by the card code, not the card name.
