Player 2|He summons Destroyer Golem in a Ruins terrain (1500 → 1950) and it attacks the hidden monster, which is Chaos Pot. Chaos Pot activates its effect. Shadi is unable to summon any monster from his top 5 cards so he discards them all (Charm of Shabti, Pharaohnic Retribution Ritual, Swords of Revealing Light, Remove Trap and Soul Release). Bakura hides in DEF Flesh-Eating Insect. He discards Reaper of the Cards, Defense Seal, Incubus Ghost and Change of Heart.||
Player 2|In the End Phase Bakura uses his Millennium Ring Compass effect (Charges 6 → 5) and declares Trap. Shadi has no Traps in hand to reveal once again. Shadi then uses his own symbol to regain a charge (Charges 4 → 5).||
Player 1|Bakura draws, he sets a card and ends his turn.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. He summons Man with the Eye of Wdjat in face-up DEF. Shadi uses its effect to look at Bakura's set card. It is revealed to be Diabound Ritual. Curious, Shadi uses his Millennium Item effect to see his Extra Deck (Charges 5 → 2) and sees the card mentioned in that spell. For some reason that card terrifies Shadi, and even he is not sure why. Bakura smiles but says nothing, and the card goes back to its position after this effect.||
Player 1|Bakura draws. He flips his Flesh-Eating Insect into face-up DEF, targeting and destroying Man with the Eye of Wdjat.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. He summons Gravekeeper's Priest in ATK. It attacks and destroys Flesh-Eating Insect who was in DEF. He then sets a card and uses his symbol to regain charges (Charges 2 → 3)||
Player 1|Bakura draws. He summons "Hades, Demon King of the Underworld".||
Player 1|Hades attacks Gravekeeper's Priest but Shadi activates his trap Curse of the Millennium Shield, which equips Millennium Shield to Gravekeeper's Priest, buffing its DEF and preventing its destruction. Battle damage is halved but Bakura receives damage for his own attack (3000 - 2450 = 550 / 2 = 275 LP Self-Damage).|1725 - 1000|
Player 1|Bakura sets a card and passes. He hasn't activated his Millennium Item in the last rounds, as if stating that he doesn't need it to win.||
Player 2|Shadi draws and plays Flame Dancer in face-up DEF, using its effect on his Priest to allow it to attack with its DEF which is a fixed value of 3000 due to the shield.||
Player 2|The Priest attacks Hades, but Bakura activates his trap Cursed Document to weaken it (3000 → 1500 → 1300), so Hades has the higher ATK (2450). 1150 LP self damage.|1725 - 0|
Player 2|Bakura wins.||
