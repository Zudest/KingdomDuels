**[Yugioh Scrolls](/KingdomDuels/yugioh-scrolls)** takes place in a slightly different setting than the original anime and manga. It takes place in a single continuity so all the story chapters are interconnected and can be placed in the [**Timeline**](/KingdomDuels/scrolls/timeline/), and therefore there are different locations around Japan (and beyond) that are also tied to the chapters of the story, listed here:
