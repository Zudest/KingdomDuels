Player 1|Zeta Reticulant attack Silent Swordsman LV0 but Yugi activates his set Turn Jump. In the chain he uses Silent Swordsman LV0 Quick Effect to transform it. Scott also activates his Cosmic Space rule, and within it also the Life Stars Rule.||
Player 1|The chain resolves: All monsters gain Life Star Counters equal to their own Levels that will be removed one by one during each End Phase. When a monster runs out of Life Counters it is destroyed.||
Player 1|Then, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.||
Player 1|Then, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.||
Player 1|3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott's end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3. In the End Phase they lose 1 counter (Sand Fortress = 0 it is destroyed, Zeta Reticulant = 3).||
Player 2|Yugi draws. He summons Toy Magician in DEF (1500 DEF) who gains 4 Life Star Counters. He sets a card. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 2, Toy Magician = 3)||
Player 1|Scott summons Lyra the Giver in ATK (1800 → 2340), who gains 4 Life Star Counters.||
Player 1|Zeta Reticulant who gains bonus due to Space terrain (2400 → 3120) attacks Toy Magician but Yugi activates his set Toy Box, placing Toy Magician in it, preventing it from becoming a target. He then places another "Toy" card from his hand in it. Inside there they are unaffected by Life Star counters. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 1, Lyra the Giver = 3)||
Player 2|Yugi draws. He releases 1 monster from his Toy Box (Toy Tank) and activates his Crimson Enchantment Ritual to Ritual Summon Dark Red Enchanter in DEF (2200 DEF), who gains 6 Life Star Counters.||
Player 2|At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 0, Lyra the Giver = 2, Dark Red Enchanter = 5). Yugi played into defense, as he knew Scott could move at least one counter from Lyra to Zeta Reticulant to keep it on the field but he does not. As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).||
Player 1|Scott draws. He activates Alien Greed Ritual, tributing his two Eva Tokens to summon Greed Quasar in ATK, it gains 7 Life Star Counters and it has 300 ATK for each star counter so 2100.||
Player 1|Scott then activates Lyra effect, transfering its remaining 2 Life Star Counters to it for a total of 9. (2100 → 2700).||
Player 1|Greed Quasar attacks and destroys Dark Red Enchanter, gaining its Life Star counters (5) for a total of 14. Its ATK becomes 4200.||
Player 1|Finally he normal summons Eva Epsilon in ATK (1500 → 1950), so it will change any monster yugi summons into ATK position.||
Player 1|At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 13, Lyra the Giver = 0 it is destroyed, Eva Epsilon = 3)||
Player 2|At this point Scott calls Yugi to call his other self to the duel, as he considers him weak and wants to also fight the other duelist who defeated Pegasus alongside him. The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won't duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.||
Player 2|Yugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)||
Player 1|Scott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi's monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage. He takes 1000 LP of damage instead, and Toy Magician is not destroyed, instead it gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).|2000 - 1000|
Player 1|At this point Yugi activates his set Strike Back, allowing him to attack with Toy Magician and negate Greed Quasar effects, which in turn sets its ATK to 0.||
Player 1|Toy Magician (2000) destroys Greed Quasar (0). 2000 LP damage.|0 - 1000|
Player 1|Yugi wins.||Yugi doesn't get the Security Key for the next area as it is in possession of Richie, not Scott.

Player 1|Keith draws. He tributes Motor Parts Token to add a Motor card to his hand from the deck. He summons Motor Violence in ATK (2100) and equips it with Engine Tuner (2100 → 2700).||
Player 1|Motor Violence attacks Divine Knight Ishzark but Jonouchi activates his set Time Machine, returning Ishzark to the field as it was before. Keith at this point shouts at him, claiming that it is his card and he's been looking for it. Jonouchi admits that after their battle at Duelist Kingdom Keith was kicked out of the castle and he left his deck there. He figured that as he didn't care he would take that card, which pisses Keith off even more than before.||

He has 4 cards on the field now (Demonic Motor Omega, Engine Token, the set Time Wizard and 1 set card), but he tributes the Engine Token to search for a motor card on top of his deck.

Fiendish Engine attacks and destroys The Wicked Eraser. 800 LP damage.|1100 - 1450|
Player 2|The second effect of The Wicked Eraser activates, destroying every card and terrain on the field. Card Hexative and the set Time Wizard are also destroyed.||

Player 1|As one of his monsters was destroyed, Yako activates Level Resist Wall, special summoning from his hand depending on the level. Barbaros was level 8 so Yako special summons the level 1 Angel O1 (300 DEF), the Level 3 Cassimolar (1200 DEF) and the Level 4 Leraje the God of Archery (1600 DEF). He gains his LP back from the previous turn due to the special effect of Angel O1 (1900 LP). He then normal summons Votis in DEF (1900)|2000 - 2000|
Player 2|Yugi draws. Arcana Knight Joker attacks and destroys Votis. Yugi sets a card.||

Player 1|Yako draws. He activates Devil's Sanctuary, special summoning a Metal Devil Token that has an attack equal to Yugi's LP (98 ATK). The Wicked Avatar copies that ATK (99), and looks like a dark mist version Yugi's normal self, which scares his other self for a moment.||

Player 2|Yugi draws. He activates Monster Recovery, returning The Tricky to his Deck and drawing five cards.||

Both monsters clash and are both destroyed.||
Player 2|In that clash of light, Yugi sees Anzu who reassures him that she is fine and will be back soon. Yako on the other hand sees Pegasus, who vanishes into the air. As tears leak from Yako’s eyes, Yugi tells him that it’s time he let go. Yako replies that he’s gone, Master Pegasus is gone, it’s all over. He is about to surrender but Gekko stops him and tells him that he must keep dueling, for himself and not for the evil gods. Yako becomes resolute and he and Yugi clash one last time.||
