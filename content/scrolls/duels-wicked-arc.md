Player 1|Then, Silent Swordsman LV0 becomes the Alter monster Silent Swordsman (level 1), gaining 1 Life Star Counter.||
Player 1|Then, Turn Jump resolves, advancing the clock, if this would have been successful Silent Swordsman would have gained 1500 ATK (3 Standby Phases in between) and achieved 2500 ATK in total. But, as it is the End Phase of that first turn skip, all monsters lose 1 Life Star and thus Silent Swordsman is destroyed as it now has 0 Life Stars.||
Player 1|3 full turns pass in total, until it reaches Scott's end of the Battle Phase once again. Zeta Reticulant started with 7 Life Star Counters and lost 3 in the process. Sand Fortress started with 4 and lost 3. In the End Phase they lose 1 counter (Sand Fortress = 0 it is destroyed, Zeta Reticulant = 3).||
Player 2|Yugi draws. He summons Toy Magician in DEF (1500 DEF) who gains 4 Life Star Counters. He sets a card. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 2, Toy Magician = 3)||
Player 1|Scott summons Lyra the Giver in ATK (1800 → 2340), who gains 4 Life Star Counters.||
Player 1|Zeta Reticulant who gains bonus due to Space terrain (2400 → 3120) attacks Toy Magician but Yugi activates his set Toy Box, placing Toy Magician in it, preventing it from becoming a target. He then places another "Toy" card from his hand in it. Inside there they are unaffected by Life Star counters. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 1, Lyra the Giver = 3)||
Player 2|Yugi draws. He releases 1 monster from his Toy Box (Toy Tank) and activates his Crimson Enchantment Ritual to Ritual Summon Dark Red Enchanter in DEF (2200 DEF), who gains 6 Life Star Counters.||
Player 2|At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Zeta Reticulant = 0, Lyra the Giver = 2, Dark Red Enchanter = 5). Yugi played into defense, as he knew Scott could move at least one counter from Lyra to Zeta Reticulant to keep it on the field but he does not. As Zeta Reticulant is destroyed, Scott summons two Eva Tokens via its effect (2 Life Star Counters each).||
Player 1|Scott draws. He activates Alien Greed Ritual, tributing his two Eva Tokens to summon Greed Quasar in ATK, it gains 7 Life Star Counters and it has 300 ATK for each star counter so 2100.||
Player 1|Scott then activates Lyra effect, transfering its remaining 2 Life Star Counters to it for a total of 9. (2100 → 2700).||
Player 1|Greed Quasar attacks and destroys Dark Red Enchanter, gaining its Life Star counters (5) for a total of 14. Its ATK becomes 4200.||
Player 1|Finally he normal summons Eva Epsilon in ATK (1500 → 1950), so it will change any monster yugi summons into ATK position.||
Player 1|At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 13, Lyra the Giver = 0 it is destroyed, Eva Epsilon = 3)||
Player 2|At this point Scott calls Yugi to call his other self to the duel, as he considers him weak and wants to also fight the other duelist who defeated Pegasus alongside him. The other Yugi shows up, only to tell Scott that he won't duel and that his partner will flatten him as he is a true duelist. The normal Yugi comes back to the duel after this, thinking to himself that he said it before the duel began, that he would fight to save Anzu.||
Player 2|Yugi draws, he sets a card and summons Toy Magician from his Toy Box in DEF. At the End Phase all monsters lose 1 Star Counter (Greed Quasar = 12, Toy Magician = 2, Eva Epsilon = 2)||
Player 1|Scott draws. His Eva Epsilon changes Yugi's monster to ATK position. Greed Quasar (3600) attacks Toy Magician (1600). It would be 2000 LP damage to yugi, but Yugi activates Fit of Rage. He takes 1000 LP of damage instead, and Toy Magician is not destroyed, instead it gains 400 ATK (1600 → 2000).|2000 - 1000|
Player 1|At this point Yugi activates his set Strike Back, allowing him to attack with Toy Magician and negate Greed Quasar effects, which in turn sets its ATK to 0.||
Player 1|Toy Magician (2000) destroys Greed Quasar (0). 2000 LP damage.|0 - 1000|
Player 1|Yugi wins.||Yugi doesn't get the Security Key for the next area as it is in possession of Richie, not Scott.

Player 1|Keith draws. He tributes Motor Parts Token to add a Motor card to his hand from the deck. He summons Motor Violence in ATK (2100) and equips it with Engine Tuner (2100 → 2700).||
Player 1|Motor Violence attacks Divine Knight Ishzark but Jonouchi activates his set Time Machine, returning Ishzark to the field as it was before. Keith at this point shouts at him, claiming that it is his card and he's been looking for it. Jonouchi admits that after their battle at Duelist Kingdom Keith was kicked out of the castle and he left his deck there. He figured that as he didn't care he would take that card, which pisses Keith off even more than before.||

Fiendish Engine attacks and destroys The Wicked Eraser. 800 LP damage.|1100 - 1450|
Player 2|The second effect of The Wicked Eraser activates, destroying every card and terrain on the field. Card Hexative and the set Time Wizard are also destroyed.||

Player 1|Yako draws. He activates Devil's Sanctuary, special summoning a Metal Devil Token that has an attack equal to Yugi's LP (98 ATK). The Wicked Avatar copies that ATK (99), and looks like a dark mist version Yugi's normal self, which scares his other self for a moment.||

Both monsters clash and are both destroyed.||
Player 2|In that clash of light, Yugi sees Anzu who reassures him that she is fine and will be back soon. Yako on the other hand sees Pegasus, who vanishes into the air. As tears leak from Yako’s eyes, Yugi tells him that it’s time he let go. Yako replies that he’s gone, Master Pegasus is gone, it’s all over.

Player 1|In the chain, Jonouchi activates Vow of Tribe, preventing any monsters that exists on both sides of the field from attacking this turn. Therefore, the attack would be negated. But Mai activates her Magic Jammer, discarding a card, and negating that spell card. The attack resolves, Swordsman of Landstar is destroyed. 1600 LP of damage. The Harpie Ladies that Jonouchi controls lose the equip buff as they switch controllers so they return to their original ATK.|1600 - 500|
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He activates Lightning Sword Ritual, tributing the two Harpie Ladies to Ritual Summon Gilford the Lightning (2800).||

Player 2|Jonouchi draws. His Blue Flame Swordsman (1800) attacks and destroys the Harpie Lady Token in DEF, she has 3 Harpie Ladies now.||

Player 1|Mai activates Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation to destroy Blue Flame Swordsman and inflict 300 LP of damage, winning her the duel. But Jonouchi activates Blue Flame Swordsman effect to transfer its ATK to a Harpie Lady (2100 → 3900), therefore reducing the damage he would take to 0 as Phoenix Formation requires ATK higher than 0 to do damage. As Blue Flame Swordsman is destroyed, the original Flame Swordsman is special summoned to the field in ATK.||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He sets a card.||
Player 1|Mai draws. The powered up Harpie Lady (3900) attacks Flame Swordsman (1800), but Jonouchi activates his set Demon's Dice. It rolls a 1, so the ATK is not changed (3900).||
Player 1|This would effectively end the duel, but at this point Mai falters, as confusion washes over her. She had believed that victory would prove she had finally escaped the shadows of her past and moved beyond her suffering. Yet deep down, and specially after exchanging blows during the duel, she realized the truth: Marik had shattered her spirit, and though Dartz and the others offered her a distraction, she had never truly healed. Unlike Jonouchi, who fought while leaning on the support of his friends, she had been trying to carry her pain alone.||
Player 1|She activates Burial Arm, targeting and destroying her own Harpie Lady mid-attack, negating said attack, and ending her turn.||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws, but he can barely stand and he falls to the ground. Mai rushes up to him, but he cannot continue and after seeing that she is seemingly back to who she was before, he ends his turn (essentially surrendering). Second Idle Warning.||
Player 2|Mai wins due to Idleness Rule.|200 - 0|
Player 2|The Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Jonouchi. She declares that she will not let his soul be taken, but he replies that it's too late and, still protecting her, pushes her out of the ever shrinking circle. In the process, his hand catches on Mai’s Orichalcos fragment and it gets removed, crumbling as the seal passes over it on its way to claim Jonouchi's soul.||

Mirror Knight Calling (500) attacks Kaiser Glider (2400) but Kaiba uses his set Ring of Destruction to destroy it and inflict destruction damage to both of them equal to its ATK (500 LP damage to Kaiba and Dartz).|1500 - 2000 - 1500|
Player 1|Destroying the Mirror Knight Calling, would also destroy the tokens, but Dartz smiles and replaces at quick speed the four tokens with four Integration Monsters of the captured souls of Pegasus, Mai, Yugi and Jonouchi. They are not longer the Token Monsters so the destruction of Mirror Knight Calling doesn't destroy them.||
Player 3|Kaiba draws. He uses Pot of Greed to draw two cards. Kaiser Glider (2400) attacks Mirror Knight Mai (0 → 2400) to shake Yugi off his stupor of seeing his friends there. Kaiser Glider is not destroyed by it. Dartz destroys the Shield Counter on Jonouchi to prevent Mai's destruction. Kaiba sets a card.||Shield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 1
Player 2|The Other Yugi draws. He then passes his turn as he is unwilling to attack his friends.||
Player 1|Dartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights, which leaves him at 300 LP. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.|2000 - 2000 - 1500|Deck: 21 → 20
Player 1|He activates his set Twin Bow Centaur, which will allow him to toss a coin to see if monsters in a single column are destroyed. He uses it in a column containing Mirror Knight Jonouchi and Kaiser Glider. He guessed right. Kaiser Glider is destroyed, Kaiba takes 600 LP damage. Jonouchi is not destroyed because Mirror Knight Yugi intercepts the attack, losing its Shield.|2000 - 2000 - 900|Shield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 1, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0
Player 3|Kaiba draws. He summons Twilight Zone Dragon in DEF and passes.||

Player 1|Dartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field.||Deck: 20 → 19
Player 1|He summons Orichalcos Malevolence in ATK (1500 → 2000). It attacks Twilight Zone Dragon and Kaiba understands that using his dimensional effect would not be enough, so he let the attack be declared and activates his set Attack Guidance Barrier to redirect the attack to Big Shield Gardna, increasing its DEF by 600 (2600 DEF → 3200 DEF). The attack fails, but Orichalcos Kyutora nullifies the 1200 battle damage that Dartz would take, (damage absorbed 5350 + 1200 = 6550 → 2 summoning counters (12 total)). Big Shield Gardna moves to ATK due to its own effect, and its DEF returns to normal.||
Player 3|Kaiba draws. He changes his Twilight Zone Dragon to DEF and sets two cards.||
Player 2|The Other Yugi draws, he switches his Big Shield Gardna to DEF and sets a card. He then passes his turn as he is still unwilling to attack his friends.||
Player 2|As he ends his turn, the Yugi Knight suddenly speaks, telling to the Pharaoh that he should not hesitate to destroy them, as he has more important things to worry about.||
Player 2|Rafael joins the duel. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP.|2000 - 2000 - 900 - 1000|
Player 4|Rafael draws. He uses Dimension Distortion to change one Terrain to a Different Dimension one and Special Summon Backup Gardna to it in DEF. Then, he activates Celestial Sword Eatos Ritual equipping it to Backup Gardna, which allows him to Ritual Summon Guardian Eatos to the field (2500).||
Player 4|He then moves the sword to Eatos (2500 → 2800). She attacks the Mai Knight, who loses her shield counter. Eatos is destroyed.||Shield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 1, Yugi 0
Player 4|Suddenly, the Seal of Orichalcos surrounds Rafael and takes out his soul for the previous duel he had lost, now that he has once again regained his dark-side and anger towards Dartz. This mean he forfeits/surrenders the current duel.|2000 - 2000 - 900 - 0|
Player 4|Rafael loses.||
Player 1|Dartz draws. In his standby phase he has to pay 1200 LP to keep the knights. Then he regains all that health back with Deuteros as he has 5 monsters on the field. He activates Orichalcos Tritos.||Deck: 19 → 18
Player 1|He uses the effect of Orichalcos Malevolence (2000) to switch Twilight Zone Dragon to ATK Position (1200) and attacks it. Kaiba activates his set Shrink to halve its attack, but Dartz activates the effect of Orichalcos Tritos to negate and destroy Shrink. The Other Yugi activates Ambush Shield, tributing Big Shield Gardna to empower the attack of Twilight Zone Dragon by half of its DEF, capped at 1000 (2600 / 3 = 1300 → 1000). Twilight Zone Dragon (1200 → 2200) destroys Orichalcos Malevolence (2000), but Dartz receives no damage due to Orichalcos Kyutora, (damage absorbed 6550 + 200 = 6750 → 0 summoning counters (12 total)). Due to Ambush Shield, Yugi sets a card.||
Player 3|Kaiba draws. He activates The Fang of Critias, fusing the Other Yugi's set Mirror Force to Fusion Summon Mirror Force Dragon in ATK (2800), who attacks Mirror Knight Pegasus (500 → 2800), but its shield effect activates, preventing its own destruction.||Shield Counters: Jonouchi 0, Mai 0, Pegasus 0, Yugi 0
Player 3|The effect of Mirror Force Dragon activates, destroying every monster with 1000 ATK or less that Dartz controls. Kyutora and all the Mirror Knights are destroyed, and at this point the Other Yugi and Kaiba find out that the souls of the ones trapped in the Mirror Knight were released and are now safe, although once again trapped in the stone tablets on the walls.||
Player 3|As Orichalcos Kyutora was destroyed, Dartz activates Shunoros Ritual to Ritual Summon Orichalcos Shunoros, equipped with Orichalcos Dexia and Orichalcos Aristeros. Shunoros gains ATK due to the amount of damage absorbed by Kyutora represented in the 12 Summoning Counters it had (0 → 6000).||
Player 3|As his monster was destroyed, Dartz activates his Martyr Curse to force Mirror Force Dragon (2800) and Shunoros (6000) to battle, and it negates the effect of Mirror Force Dragon (2800). Shunoros destroys it. 3200 LP damage. Shunoros loses 1 counter (6000 → 5500).|2000 - 2000 - 0 - 0|

Player 1|Dartz draws. Orichalcos Shunoros (5500) attacks Elf Swordsman (1200 DEF). The Other Yugi activates Soul Shield to negate the destruction and end the battle phase, paying half his LP. Shunoros loses 1 counter (5500 → 5000).|2000 - 1700 - 0 - 0|Deck: 18 → 17
Player 2|The Other Yugi draws "Legend of Heart" and activates it. Paying 1000 LP and tributing his Elf Swordsman to special summon The Eye of Timaeus, The Fang of Critias and The Claw of Hermos from anywhere with its effects negated, and then Alter Summon with them. He summons the Knighted Alter monsters of Legendary Knight Timaeus, Legendary Knight Hermos, Legendary Knight Critias in ATK.|2000 - 700 - 0 - 0|
Player 2|Due to Legend of Heart, the Seal of Orichalcos is destroyed.||
Player 2|Timaeus (2800) attacks Shunoros (5000 → 4500), the attack fails but the effect of Timaeus activate (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), negating the destruction and damage and allowing Hermos to attack Shunoros (4500 → 4000), and it happens again, negating the destruction and damage and allowing Critias to attack Shunoros (4000→ 3500), the attack fails but Shunoros now has 3500 ATK.||
Player 1|Dartz draws. Shunoros (3500) attacks Critias but the other Yugi activate the effect of Critias (gaining Protector due to its own effect) to activate Mirror Force in his graveyard, which reflects the attack, destroying Shunoros.||Deck: 17 → 16
Player 1|As Shunoros is destroyed, Dartz activates Ritual of the Blasphemous Leviathan to Ritual Summon The Wicked Leviathan (Wicked God Ge) in ATK (infinite). Dartz LP is reduced to 0, but he cannot lose while his Wicked God is on the field. He also activates the Rule Wicked God Pantheon. Seeing that there is a Wicked God card on the field, Anzu starts acting strange.|0 - 700 - 0 - 0|
Player 1|In his End Phase Dartz activates his Order to an Honorable Death to force Yugi to attack his Wicked Leviathan or he would destroy his monsters.||
Player 2|The Other Yugi draws. He knows he can't attack, so he sets a card and passes.||
Player 2|Suddenly, Anzu joins the duel, saying that she will help him this time, and that her deck is calling her to intercede. Intrusion penalty 1000 LP. Honda, Mokuba and The Other Yugi try to stop her but she refuses. Yugi ends his turn.|0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1000|
Player 5|Anzu draws. She activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Yugi's Chaos Soldier. As she returned a monster from the graveyard to the field she can Special Summon from her hand Maiden of the Moonlight. Then, she uses Angel's Lifeblood to tribute Maiden of the Moonlight and Special Summon Nuvia The Wicked Goddess from her top 6 cards, and gain 300 LP. This activates the effect of Maiden of the Moonlight, allowing her to Special Summon an Angel monster from her hand, and she chooses Friendship.|0 - 700 - 0 - 0 - 1300|
Player 5|Then, she activates RItual of the Blasphemous Avatar and tribute all three monsters to Ritual Summon The Wicked Avatar, to everyone's surprise, specially to the Other Yugi.||
Player 5|She tells him that she felt a connection with that card ever since the incident in the Kaiba Corporation building, and ended up recovering the card and keeping it to herself. Due to the weird things that happened back then, she became attuned to the wicked card and could hear it. Even talk to it. Yugi warns her that the card is evil, but she insists that it is not anymore, she is sure of it. And that she will use it to help him win the duel and rescue their friends together. Dartz mocks the card, saying that its power originally was drawn from The Wicked God Ge by Pegasus, and is a pale recreation of the true power of the Leviathan. Anzu had the impulse to fight after seeing Dartz summon The Wicked God Ge, and now knows why: she says that it's because the Avatar wanted to fight it itself.||
Player 5|For a moment, the Wicked Avatar takes the shape of a completely black Anzu and then transforms into a black version of Geh. It attacks the Wicked God Geh, whose attack is infinity. The Wicked Avatar ATK also becomes infinity (it cannot add 1 to infinity so the attack is infinity). But it doesn't matter: defeating it would mean defeating dartz, and they have equal strength so they should kill eachother. However Wicked God Ge cannot be destroyed in battle with a Wicked God of equal or lower Hierarchy. The Wicked Avatar is destroyed, as Dartz laughs soundly. The impact of the attack knocks Anzu back.||
Player 1|Dartz draws. He uses Defense Seal to change Timaeus to ATK. Wicked God Ge (infinity) attacks (Dartz mills 5 cards) and destroys Legendary Knight Timaeus (2800). The Other Yugi takes infinite LP damage so his LP goes to 0. The actual Seal of Orichalcos reappears and surrounds the other Yugi, but it breaks after revealing the fact that he hasn't lost just yet. Yugi activated his set Relay Soul, to Special Summon Dark Magician Girl in DEF (1700 DEF) and attach his life to her: if she is destroyed he will lose.|0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1300|Deck: 16 → 15, 10
Player 1|Dartz activates Impact Revive to special summon Legendary Knight Timaeus with an ATK increase (2800 → 3300) and allowing him to attack again. Wicked God Ge attacks Dark Magician Girl (he mills 5 cards).||Deck: 10 → 5
Player 1|The Other Yugi activates Hermos effect to redirect the attack to itself (gaining Protector due to Critias effect), but then he gains the effect of Elf Swordsman so it cannot be destroyed by monsters with 1900 original ATK or higher (and given that Wicked God Geh original ATK is infinity, Hermos is not destroyed).||
Player 2|The Other Yugi draws. Now that all his monsters have Protector, he uses Timaeus effect to Fusion them together into The Knight of Destiny, who copies the ATK of the strongest card on the field, becoming infinite. It (infinity) attacks Wicked God Ge (infinity). Both monsters are destroyed as they have equal stats.||
Player 2|Since Dartz life was tied to Wicked God Ge, he loses the duel. Yugi still has his Dark Magician Girl, so he and Anzu agree on a shared victory.||
