Player 4|Jonouchi draws Mimic Illusionist and activates it as a spell, targeting Force and activating it. Mei (900 / 2 = 450) and Kyu (900 / 2 = 450) lose LP. These LP are added to Black Demons Dragon, up to the 4000 cap (3200 + 900 = 4100 (- 100 due to cap) = 4000). He cant attack so he passes.|450 + 450 vs 400 + 650|
Player 1|Kyu draws. He uses Hyuuga (3050) to attack Suga (2200 DEF), the attack is negated due to Suga's effect.||

Player 3|Yugi draws. He uses Monster Replace to switch the position of Dark Magician (from E2 to E9) and Black Demon's Dragon (from E9 to E2).||
Player 3|Black Demon's Dragon (4000) attacks Sanga (3000). It is going to inflict 1000 LP (to Kyu, its controller) but by halving it due to its effect it inflicts 500 LP to both Mei and Kyu.|0 + 0 vs 400 + 650|
