Player 1|Bakura activates Ritual of the Sun of God Dragon, tributing his three monsters to Ritual Summon Ra in ATK (?), and thanks to Marik he can enact the chant and summon it properly. But Marik activates his set Joyful Death Agony so all the tributed monsters have their ATK become 0 when they are tributed. He also gains 400 LP for each, so he gains 1200 LP.

{{< dueltable header1="EP 86" header2="Marik vs Jonouchi" >}}Setup|First Semifinal. Duel in Duel Tower (3 arena + 2 sea).|2000 - 2000|
Setup|Ante Rule Setup. Marik bets Ritual of the Sun of God Dragon. Jonouchi bets Psychic Ritual.||

Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He summons Wyvern Warrior in DEF (1200).||

Player 1|Marik draws. He summons Hell Poet Helpoemer in ATK (2000) and sets a card. Drillago destroys a Sheep Token.||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He summons Rocket Warrior in ATK (1500). Rocket Warrior uses its strike effect in Helpoemer, reducing its ATK (2000 → 1500). In response, Marik uses his Card of Last Will to draw 2 cards.||

Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He tributes a Sheep Token to make Panther Warrior (2000) attack Helpoemer (1500). 500 LP damage.|1300 - 2000|
Player 2|As Helpoemer was destroyed, Marik activates his trap Hidden Soldiers, allowing him to special summon Plasma Eel from his hand in ATK (500), activating its effect and equipping itself to Panther Warrior on Jonouchi's side of the field.||
Player 2|Since Helpoemer was destroyed in battle while in ATK position, it is sent to the opponent's graveyard. Jonouchi has to discard a card from his hand on each Battle Phase. During the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer's effect forces Jonouchi to discard 1 card.||
Player 2|At the End Phase, Plasma Eel effect activates decreasing the ATK of Panther Warrior (2000 → 1500).||
Player 1|Marik draws. He doesn't attack, he is enjoying damaging Jonouchi's monsters to torture him. He sets two cards and passes.||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He summons Baby Dragon in face-up DEF (700 DEF). Rocket Warrior uses its Strike effect to weaken Drillago (1600 → 1100).||
Player 2|At the end of the Battle Phase, Helpoemer activates and Jonouchi discards a random card (Insectorum Ritual). At the end phase Plasma Eel effect activates, weakening Panther Warrior (1500 → 1000).||
Player 1|Marik draws. He sets a card and then activates his Dark Ritual of Legend, eroding Gil Garth from his graveyard (due to Tribute Burial lingering effect) to summon Legend Devil in ATK (1500).||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. Marik activates his set Torture Wheel and targets Rocket Warrior.||
Player 2|Jonouchi summons Little Winguard in face-up DEF and changes Panther Warrior to DEF too. At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior's ATK decreases (1000 → 500).||
Player 1|Marik draws. The effect of Torture Wheel activates, inflicting 250 of direct damage to Jonouchi. Then Legend Devil gains 600 ATK due to its own effect.|1300 - 1750|
Player 1|Legend Devil (2100) attacks and destroys Little Winguard (1800 DEF). Marik activates his Coffin Seller, inflicting damage every time a monster is destroyed. Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller. Marik then sets a card.|1300 - 1700|
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He activates Pot of Greed to draw 2 cards. He activates Quiz: Marik has to guess which card is the one at the bottom on the graveyard. He cannot guess correctly, and Jonouchi adds Psycho Shocker to his hand, which was discarded due to Tribute Burial.||
Player 2|Jonouchi summons Tiger Axe (1300) and activates Psychic Ritual to Ritual summon Psycho Shocker (2400). Jonouchi loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller when tributing Tiger Axe. On its summon, Marik activates his trap Wicked God's Catastrophe but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it.|1300 - 1650|
Player 2|Psycho Shocker (2400) attacks and destroys Legend Devil (2100). It would be 300 LP of Damage, but Marik activates his set Protective Seal Wall of Darkness to prevent taking the damage and draws 1 card instead. He loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.|1250 - 1650|
Player 2|At the end of the battle phase Helpoemer activates and forces him to discard a random card (Fusion). At the end phase Plasma Eel activates and Panther Warrior's ATK decreases (500 → 0).||
Player 1|Marik draws. Torture Wheel activates but Psycho Shocker negates it and destroys it, freeing Rocket Warrior.||
Player 1|He then uses Lava Devil Ritual to tribute Psycho Shocker and Baby Dragon to Ritual Summon Lava Golem in ATK (3000) in Jonouchi's side of the field. Jonouchi loses 100 LP by Coffin Seller due to their monsters being destroyed.|1250 - 1550|
Player 1|Marik sets a card. He didn't play a monster to his side of the field so he gets an Idle Warning (Plasma Eel is on jonouchi's side of the field).||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. Marik has no monsters for him to attack so he passes.||
Player 2|In the end of the battle phase Helpoemer makes Jonouchi discard a random card (Swordsman of Landstar). Plasma Eel can't reduce the ATK of Panther Warrior anymore. At the End Phase Lava Golem inflicts 400 LP of damage to Jonouchi.|1250 - 1150|
Player 1|Marik draws. He activates his set Monster Relief to return Plasma Eel to his hand and then summons it on the field on face-up DEF, but he does not activate its equip effect.||
Player 1|Instead, he activates Machine Duplication Technique targeting the Eel to special summon 2 Clone Tokens targeting Plasma Eel. Marik equips one Plasma Eel Token to Rocket Warrior, and another to Lava Golem. He then sets a card.||
Player 2|Jonouchi draws. He activates Angel's Dice to roll a die and multiply the ATK of Plasma Eel by that result. He gets a four (500 → 2000). Since the ATK now exceeds 500, Machine Duplication and the two tokens are destroyed, allowing him to tribute his monsters once again. Coffin Seller does not trigger because the tokens are not sent to the graveyard.||
Player 2|Jonouchi activates Lightning Sword Ritual and tributes all three of his monsters (Rocket Warrior, Lava Golem and Panther Warrior) to ritual summon Gilford the Lightning. He loses 150 LP due to Coffin Seller. By tributing three monsters, Gilford allows Jonouchi to battle lock Plasma Eel into ATK.|1250 - 1000|
Player 2|Gilford (2800) attacks Plasma Eel (2000), but Marik activates his set Nightmare's Demon Mirror to negate the attack by discarding a card, he discards the Ritual to summon Ra.||
Player 2|Helpoemer activates but Jonouchi has no more cards in hand.||
Player 1|Marik draws. He erodes Ra's Ritual from his graveyard to send Ra to the graveyard from the Extra Deck. He then activates Resurrection of the Dead to revive Ra in ATK (0). He then transforms it into God Phoenix, it attacks and destroys Gilford the Lightning .||
Player 1|Due to this being a Yami no Game, Jonouchi takes a lot of real damage, but somehow he is still standing due to tremendous willpower. Marik is surprised by this, as he was counting on Ra's attack to completely destroy his mind. Marik feels he is in actual danger of losing now, he has no more useful cards in hand or field, and only controls Plasma Eel (500) in ATK battle locked due to Gilford.||
Player 1|At the End Phase Ra is destroyed due to being special summoned from the graveyard. Marik loses 50 LP due to Coffin Seller.|1200 - 1000|
Player 2|Jonouchi, barely standing, draws Gearfried the Iron Knight. He summons it in ATK (1800, which would be enough to win as Plasma Eel has only 500 ATK) but at that moment and due to his condition, he collapses.||
Player 2|As Jonouchi can't continue the duel, Marik wins.|1200 - 0|Marik decides not to take any card from him. The penalty game for the Shadow Game is death, and Jonouchi stops breathing for a moment but he fights and ends up in a coma.
