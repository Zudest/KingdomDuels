Player 4|He then activates Short to switch the battle position of all current machine monsters they control, preventing them to move or attack until the end phase.||
Player 4|Machine King gains attack for every other machine monster and also field power bonus so (1600 + 480 + 600 = 2680) attacks The Forgiving Nun (850). Honda summons his Raremetal Knight in DEF and uses his deckmaster effect to set a spell card in otogi's field under his control, he blocks the attack from Machine King with Raremetal Knight, which is destroyed.||
Player 4|At this point Otogi uses his Deck Master effect to create a clone token copy of Command Angel.||
Player 4|As Raremetal Knight was his Deck Master, Honda loses.|640 - 0 - 1400 - 2000|
Player 1|Shizuka skips her turn due to inactivity (she is in shock after Honda "died").||
Player 3|Otogi draws. He activates Worm Hole, rolling a 5 and attaching his three monsters to the spell card. He then summons God Orgoth. He attacks Machine King with it, rolling the dice and gaining 600 ATK (2250 → 2850). Machine King (1600 + 480 + 300 = 2380) is destroyed. 470 LP damage to Ota.|640 - 0 - 1400 - 1530|

Otogi rolls a dice and he gets a 4. God Orgoth (2250 → 2650) is destroyed. 1260 LP damage to Otogi.|640 - 0 - 140 - 1530|
Player 1|Shizuka nearly gives up hope, but Jonouchi and the rest arrive, encouraging her. She draws and uses her Deck Master effect to discard a spell card (Holy Elf's Blessing) and search for a ritual in her deck. She plays Dreamful Freedom Ritual, tributing Fallen Angel Marie and the Forgiving Nun, to Ritual Summon Saint Jeanne. The command angel on the field buffs her (2800 → 3000).||
Player 1|Otogi at this point, following a comment by Yugi about using the help of Honda, activates his set face-down card hoping it will be useful. It ends up being Rare Metal Soul, which buffs Saint Jeanne in the battle phase.||
Player 1|Shizuka declares an attack. Saint Jeanne attacks (3000) and ties in attack with Perfect Machine King (2700 + 810 + 100 = 3610) due to Rare Metal Soul (changes her attack to 3610), both monsters are destroyed.||
Player 1|Since Perfect Machine King was his Deck Master, Ota loses.|640 - 0 - 140 - 0|
Player 1|Shizuka and Otogi agree on a shared victory.||

Player 1|Noah summons Vic Viper and equips it with Cyclon Laser. It attacks (1200 → 1500) and destroys Twilight Zone Dragon (1500 DEF) due to its secondary effect that changes its ATK to 1600 during battle calculation only.||

All Wasteland terrains are transformed to Meadow terrains, and Noah gains 200 LP for each attached card used in the ritual, so 1800 LP gain.|2980 - 2720|Seventh of the seven turns.
Player 1|He then summons an Integration Summon, turning himself into Noah-Shinato, King of Heaven and making it its new Deckmaster monster.||

Player 2|Kaiba draws, and at this point his Last Battle activates itself. Noah decides to not pay the LP to negate it thinking that he will take this opportunity to defeat Kaiba, and choose the Terrain in which Noah-Shinato is. Kaiba picks an empty "Meadow" Terrain.||
Player 2|Kaiba summons his Deckmaster to the field and activates Resurrection of the Dead to resurrect Blue-Eyes White Dragon in the zone that can battle. Then Kaiba uses his Lord of Dragon Deck Master effect to change one terrain to Dragon Valley, making its Blue-Eyes gain Field Power Bonus. Noah sees his plan now, but he can't target Blue-Eyes to weaken it with his card due to Lord of Dragon's protection. Blue-Eyes White Dragon (3900) attacks and destroys Noah-Shinato (3300). 600 LP damage inflicted. Noah prevents its Deckmaster from being sent to the Graveyard, but it doesn't matter at this point.|2380 - 1210|
Player 2|In the End Phase the effect of Last Battle resolves, and the only remaining monster in the chosen Monster Zone is Blue-Eyes White Dragon.|0 - 1210|
Player 2|Kaiba wins.||

Player 1|Bakura plays his Millennium Ring into the Rule Zone.||
Player 1|He plays a monster in hidden DEF and sets a card.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. Bakura activates his Millennium Ring Mind Compass effect (Charges 7 → 6) and declares Trap. Shadi has no Traps in hand to reveal.||
Player 2|Shadi then plays his Millennium Key into the Rule Zone and uses its effect to force bakura to play one of the cards (Charges 7 → 4).||
Player 2|He summons Millennium Golem in ATK in the Ruins (2000 → 2600). Then, he plays on the field his Judgment of the Dead. He then goes to activate its effect but in response Bakura laughs and activates his set Magic Removal, destroying Judgment of the Dead before the subduel happens, and due to it leaving the field Shadi loses 1000 LP.|2000 - 1000|
Player 2|Shadi attacks with his Millennium Golem, but the attacked card was Electric Lizard, so Millennium Golem cannot attack on its next turn.||
Player 1|Bakura draws, he plays a monster in hidden DEF, sets the card Shadi forced him to play and passes.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. Given than his Millennium Golem cannot attack due to Electric Lizard, Shadi figures that Bakura doesn't want his monster to be attacked.||
Player 2|He summons Destroyer Golem in a Ruins terrain (1500 → 1950) and it attacks the hidden monster, which is Chaos Pot. Chaos Pot activates its effect. Shadi is unable to summon any monster from his top 5 cards so he discards them all (Charm of Shabti, Pharaohnic Retribution Ritual, Swords of Revealing Light, Remove Trap and Soul Release). Bakura hides in DEF Flesh-Eating Insect. He discards Reaper of the Cards, Defense Seal, Incubus Ghost and Change of Heart.||
Player 2|In the End Phase Bakura uses his Millennium Ring Compass effect (Charges 6 → 5) and declares Trap. Shadi has no Traps in hand to reveal once again. Shadi then uses his own symbol to regain a charge (Charges 4 → 5).||
Player 1|Bakura draws, he sets a card and ends his turn.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. He summons Man with the Eye of Wdjat in face-up DEF. Shadi uses its effect to look at Bakura's set card. It is revealed to be Diabound Ritual. Curious, Shadi uses his Millennium Item effect to see his Extra Deck (Charges 5 → 2) and sees the card mentioned in that spell. For some reason that card terrifies Shadi, and even he is not sure why. Bakura smiles but says nothing, and the card goes back to its position after this effect.||
Player 1|Bakura draws. He flips his Flesh-Eating Insect into face-up DEF, targeting and destroying Man with the Eye of Wdjat.||
Player 2|Shadi draws. He summons Gravekeeper's Priest in ATK. It attacks and destroys Flesh-Eating Insect who was in DEF. He then sets a card and uses his symbol to regain charges (Charges 2 → 3)||
Player 1|Bakura draws. He summons "Hades, Demon King of the Underworld".||
Player 1|Hades attacks Gravekeeper's Priest but Shadi activates his trap Curse of the Millennium Shield, which equips Millennium Shield to Gravekeeper's Priest, buffing its DEF and preventing its destruction. Battle damage is halved but Bakura receives damage for his own attack (3000 - 2450 = 550 / 2 = 275 LP Self-Damage).|1725 - 1000|
Player 1|Bakura sets a card and passes. He hasn't activated his Millennium Item in the last rounds, as if stating that he doesn't need it to win.||
Player 2|Shadi draws and plays Flame Dancer in face-up DEF, using its effect on his Priest to allow it to attack with its DEF which is a fixed value of 3000 due to the shield.||
Player 2|The Priest attacks Hades, but Bakura activates his trap Cursed Document to weaken it (3000 → 1500 → 1300), so Hades has the higher ATK (2450). 1150 LP self damage.|1725 - 0|
Player 2|Bakura wins.||
