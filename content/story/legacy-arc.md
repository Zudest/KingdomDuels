_"As normal life returns, grudges and events from the past resurface to challenge Yugi's other self and Kaiba, as they start to unravel a mystery that seems to tie them to Ancient Egypt."_

>**Author's Note**: My main goal in this arc was to tie multiple short storylines into one cohesive narrative block. Having the egyptian exhibition in the museum play a larger role here allows me to flesh out more characters like Ishizu and Shadi. A major goal of this arc aswell was to move the virtual arc here, to have it happen before Battle City which will in turn make Battle City flow better without that interruption before the finals. Overall, this whole arc was also a good chance to focus on the side characters for a bit and plant some seeds for upcoming future plots, while focusing on the past and legacy of both the Other Yugi and Kaiba.

## Episode 41 - Memories of the Kingdom

![](/img/storyimg/ep0041.jpg)

---

*   In Pegasus Castle, Yugi and his friends are reunited with Bakura and Mokuba. Mr. Crocketts apologizes for Pegasus being absent, and gives Yugi a card called "The Ties of Friendship" as proof of his championship title, along with the check for the prize, which Yugi gives to Jonouchi.
*   Outside the castle the gang meet up with Kaiba, who is grateful to see his little brother Mokuba, but warns Yugi they will duel sooner or later. He then leaves toward his helicopter and the guys follow him asking if he can give them a ride to the city, something Mokuba happily agrees. Mai also joins them on the helicopter since she doesn't have another way out of the island.
*   While flying home, they talk and start to rememorate duels from the tournament and how they got to the island. Jonouchi asks Mai about her first opponents and she briefly mentions the ones she defeated to get 8 stars as boring and uninteresting, with the exception of Jonouchi himself. That said, after her loss to Panik she felt in debt to Yugi so she started really early the following morning, searching duelists all over the island. There were few duelists left, and she assumed a bunch of them had been defeated by the Player Killers that night.
*   In a duel arena she found Kajiki and Ryuzaki **[dueling](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-41---ryuzaki-vs-kajiki)** and decided to watch first and then duel the winner, since they were betting six star chips in total, 3 on each side (Ryuzaki had 3 chips after losing to Jonouchi). Yugi recalls that after he defeated Kajiki that first day Kajiki still had 1 star chip, so he definetely got one or two more wins after that to reach 3.
*   Near the end of that duel, Mai saw three duelists on the beach below them finding some star chips on the sand and screaming in joy about it. Jonouchi and Yugi interrupt her with surprise, saying that those were definetely the star chips Mokuba stole and were thrown into the sea. Kaiba, who was just passively hearing from the front seat, asks Mokuba about that. He admits with regret of stealing the chips from that poor kid.
*   Jonouchi ask Mai to describe those three duelist and when she does, they clearly associate them to the ones they met on the Graveyard Field. Mai saw how those three kept a Star Chip each (that's all they found apparently) and went into a cave near the beach. She followed their tracks, dismissing the Ryuzaki and Kajiki duel for the moment, and once she reached the cave she challenged them. Satake and Takaido ignored her and kept going through the caves, stating that they knew of a shortcut to the castle and that they had business with someone (Anzu assumes they meant Keith for sure).
*   Kotsuzuka guided her to the Graveyard field, and once in there he revealed that he hid another star chip from the others. Mai **[challenged](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-41---kotsuzuka-vs-mai)** him by betting all her 8 star chips for his 2, and defeated him. She then went ahead on the caves searching for the other two duelists and got lost. Halfway through her path she met Kajiki who was searching for her after defeating Ryuzaki. She agreed to duel him but only after they find the other two that fled, since she was thinking that defeating Kajiki and those two will net her with exactly 18 star chips to repay Yugi.
*   They walked through the caves, with Kajiki talking about his father and his duel with Ryuzaki that was a revenge for the japanese tournament, and a bunch of other things that Mai didn’t really cared about. They finally got to the Labyrinth entrance, which they went through just in time to see the Meikyu brothers finishing Takaido and Satake in a duel.
*   Mai teamed up with Kajiki to **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-41---brother-mei--brother-kyu-vs-mai--kajiki)** Mei and Kyu. The two brothers however refused to bet Star Chips. They said that to leave the cave they would need to beat them, but that the time limit for the classification round was near and that the Player Killers were tasked by Pegasus to stall for time since there were less star chips available for duelists at this point.
*   Mai and Kajiki won that hard fought duel, but didn’t get extra star chips for it. They got out of the Labyrinth but the time was running out and there weren’t any more duelist around so the two of them decided to bet all their star chips together and see which would make it to the castle. Mai won the **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-41---kajiki-vs-mai)** and gathered 16 star chips in total. She would then go on to meet the guys and the rest is known.
*   Yugi and the others then talk about the finals. Bakura is shown quietly looking through the window. They all get to Domino Port in the middle of the night and part ways for now, with Kaiba declaring once again to Yugi that he will duel him at some point pretty soon.

## Episode 42 - The Big Five

![](/img/storyimg/ep0042.jpg)

---

*   On the following morning, inside Kaiba Corporation headquarters, the Kaiba brothers confront The Big Five for making an alliance with Pegasus and trying to take over their company. However, they manipulate Kaiba into trying his new virtual game, Duel Monsters Quest. All seven go into the virtual world using some special virtual pod machines, but in reality this is their plan B after Pegasus' defeat. In secret the Big Five planned to defeat Kaiba in the virtual world using cheats, and have arranged the machine to have the loser of the duel actually lose their mind in the virtual world. By doing that, they would be able to take the company keys that the brothers hold and become the majority shareholder themselves.
*   The virtual world looks real and is brilliantly made. Suddenly, the Big Five change the environment and challenge Kaiba and Mokuba to a **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-42---the-big-five-vs-kaiba--mokuba)**. They will be using the Boss Rules for team duels, which means that they would collectively share a board and have their turn iterate with the Kaiba brothers. Even after they stacked their deck to have the perfect initial hand and summoned "Five God Dragon", a legendary Fusion monster, Kaiba takes the initiative and with the crucial help of his brother manages to overcome them and win.
*   The brothers leave the virtual world. Kaiba, unaware of what just happened to the minds of the Big Five and just seeing all of them unresponsive in their virtual simulator pods, orders his men to remove them from his presence.

## Episode 43 - The Girl from America

![](/img/storyimg/ep0043.jpg)

---

*   The day after returning to the city, Yugi goes to the hospital to see his grandfather and hugs him as he is conscious now, his mother is there aswell. Sugoroku is excited about the Egyptian Exhibition that is said to be coming soon to the city (he watched the news about that on the hospital TV early that day) and wants to get in contact with a friend of his, professor Yoshimori.
*   Sugoroku is released from the hospital. Yugi and his friends take him home, where they find an American girl waiting for them. She introduces herself as Rebecca, a twelve-year-old prodigy Duelist who is accusing Sugoroku of stealing her "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". She demands it back, but the gang and Sugoroku have a problem with this as Seto ripped it up in the first episode.
*   Rebecca challenges Sugoroku to a Duel for it, but since he just got out of the hospital, Yugi (and not his other-self) takes his place. They **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-43---rebecca-vs-yugi-arthur-vs-sugoroku)** at the new arena in Kaiba Land. During the Duel, Sugoroku notices Rebecca's Deck and strategy are very similar to an old friend of his named Arthur Hopkins. Rebecca reveals herself to be Arthur's granddaughter, and continues to accuse him of theft.
*   Sugoroku tells the story of how he met Arthur. It was at an archaeological dig in Egypt years ago. Arthur was reading some Egyptian hieroglyphs and noticed they resemble Duel Monsters, making him believe that ancient Egyptians used these monsters in battle for power and control. Unfortunately, no one believed him, but he never gave up on his research. One day, Sugoroku and Arthur were in a tomb when the roof caved in, trapping the two men. There was only enough water for one person, so they decide to **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-43---rebecca-vs-yugi-arthur-vs-sugoroku)** for it. In the end, Sugoroku decided to surrender, even though he could have won, because he knew Arthur would need the water more than him. He notices the Duel between Rebecca and Yugi is going in the exact same way as the Duel he had back then.
*   In the end, Yugi does surrender. Rebecca demands her "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" card back. Sugoroku reluctantly shows the card to Rebecca, which has been taped together. Rebecca rages out of control upon seeing this as she thinks Sugoroku tore it up. Sugoroku tries to tell Rebecca he would never do such a thing, but Rebecca again won't listen to him. At this point, Arthur arrives and tells Rebecca to behave herself.
*   Arthur shows Rebecca the top card of Yugi's Deck, which was "Soul Release", and that it would have allowed Yugi to win the duel. Rebecca is shocked upon finding out about this, but she asks why did Yugi forfeit when he had the chance to win. Arthur explains that Yugi deliberately forfeited to teach Rebecca about the Heart of the Cards and that there is more to life than winning. Rebecca apologizes and to prove their friendship, Yugi gives her the "The Ties of Friendship" card. Sugoroku talks a bit with his friend, asking him why is he there and Arthur explains that he’s in the city to see the egyptian exhibition on the museum that’s coming up in a few days.
*   Arthur mention that he got the Blue-Eyes card originally from Pegasus, after he consulted with him in regards to Duel Monsters and egyptology design. He also forgives Sugoroku for what happened with the card.

## Episode 44 - The Mysterious Transfer Student – Ryuji Otogi

![](/img/storyimg/ep0044.jpg)

---

*   Back in school we can see Anzu and Honda having a practice **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-44---honda-vs-anzu)** that Anzu wins. Honda is getting practice but he is still a total newcomer. Meanwhile Jonouchi is a bit jealous that a new student called Ryuji Otogi is attracting all the girls with dice tricks. Otogi gets Jonouchi involved with one of the tricks, and by playing off of Jonouchi’s gullibility, the trick works. Jonouchi gets angry and he challenges him to a duel. Otogi agrees but only if they duel by drafting new booster packs. They also make a bet, the loser will be the winner’s pet for a week.
*   They go to Otogi’s game shop that has a Duel Arena. While getting there a small flashback is shown of Otogi discussing getting revenge against Yugi with an employee of his. He claims that Yugi only defeated Pegasus in Duelist Kingdom by cheating, and plans to expose him to the world.
*   The game shop is full of people. Otogi says that he will broadcast the duel on the screens and they draft the cards. Jonouchi is confident with what he got. Then the **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-44---otogi-vs-jonouchi)** begins, and after some back and forth Jonouchi makes some big misplays by not knowing or reading properly his cards and Otogi ends up taking the duel.
*   Having won the bet, Otogi orders Jonouchi to put on a dog suit that he got him. Seeing his friend humiliated by Otogi, Yugi gets angry and challenges him to a duel. If he wins, Jonouchi will be released from the deal. Otogi agrees, but says that if he wins, Yugi will swear on his grandfather’s life that he will never play Duel Monsters again and give up his title of “King of Games”.

## Episode 45 - Showdown! The Dungeon Dice Field

![](/img/storyimg/ep0045.jpg)

---

*   The **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-45---otogi-vs-yugi)** begins in a special field called “Dungeon Dice Field” that has some interesting rules that change how the regular duel monster game is played. Yugi has to learn on the go and struggles at first, but eventually is able to pull up a good combo and wins.
*   During the duel Otogi tells him about how he is the actual inventor of the Dungeon Dice Field along with some other cards, that he started to collaborate with Industrial Illusions as a card designer and that he wanted to push his project forward. He had a contract with them and even met Pegasus himself, but after the Duelist Kingdom tournament was over Pegasus has dropped off the face of the earth. Therefore he had some grudge against Yugi, blaming him for what happened to Pegasus.
*   After the duel, Otogi apologizes for how he treated them and they all end up in good terms. Moments later, his laptop signals a message. He opens the email, and with a thrill, he sees that Industrial Illusions has sent a production contract after all. 

_NOTE: Instead of a Dungeon Dice Monster duel they will play a normal duel but with DDM terrain and rules, as a way to mix both ideas. The focus of this project is on Kingdom Duels so its best if we keep everything related to the rules we are creating._

## Episode 46 - Jonouchi's Sister

![](/img/storyimg/ep0046.jpg)

---

*   The Egyptian Exhibition is about to begin in a few days and the Domino Museum staff is hard at work preparing for it. At school, Jonouchi is having a practice **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-46---honda-vs-jonouchi)** with Honda when Yugi tells them about the exhibition and that his grandpa can let them in on the premiere day thanks to him knowing a university professor who works there. They all decide to go (although Jonouchi is scared of mummies), but when he checks the date he says that he might not be able to go with them after all.
*   Jonouchi tells them that he has received the prize money from Industrial Illusions and started the process of scheduling her sisters operation. Shizuka herself is coming to visit him on that very same day when the museum exhibition begins, so he don't think he can go with them. Instead, they all agree to hang out with her instead, regardless of what Jonouchi wanted.
*   A few days later they meet Shizuka at Jonouchi's place, in the morning, and Honda falls for her at first sight. Otogi joins them too this time, after being invited by Yugi and Anzu. They all go to spend the day together, a happy slice of life day. Shizuka is a kind soul and she is proud of her brother, and grateful of him giving her the chance of being able to cure her eyes. She is secretly worried about the operation, and although she says nothing, Anzu picks up on this and comforts her for a bit.
*   At some point in the afternoon Yugi tells them that he is leaving to go with his grandpa to the museum for the opening of the exhibition, but they all decide to join him anyway, including Shizuka and Otogi. They arrive and meet Sugoroku waiting for them alongside two other men. They are greeted by professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku's friend) and Kanekura (the curator of the museum), who stares at Yugi's Millennium Puzzle for a bit but says nothing.
*   They spend the rest of the day there, roaming around the museum while Yoshimori gives them the tour, explaining different egyptian concepts like for example the Weighting of the Feather and the judgment: The crimes that people made would be measured with a scale.
*   There are a few important egyptian pieces that will be arriving in a few days, but Yoshimori says that there is also a really interesting collaboration that they are having that week with Kaiba Corporation and their virtual reality pods, that can transport one to a virtual recreation of ancient egypt so they can actually walk and explore that place.
*   Interested in the experience, they all go into the pods and jump into the virtual world. They start wandering, surprised by how real everything feels, when suddenly something strange happens and the landscape changes as they fell in what seems like an endless digital pit of green numbers and grids.
*   Outside the pods, in the real world, Yoshimori is worried because the equipment seems to be malfunctioning. Sugoroku attempts to free Yugi but Yoshimori stops him, saying that freeing them now could cause damage in their brains. He wonders how could this be happening.

## Episode 47 - A Virtual Nightmare

![](/img/storyimg/ep0047.jpg)

---

*   The group (Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Anzu, Otogi and Shizuka) were exploring an egyptian temple in a virtual reality pod in the museum when they got trapped inside. Arriving to a weird digital-looking place, they are unsure of what is happening, when suddenly a young kid with teal hair shows up in multiple screens in front of them. He presents himself as Noah, and says that they were all invited there as a suggestion of his allies: the Big Five, who show up in multiple screens aswell. They explain who they are, and what happened to them after their duel with Kaiba and Mokuba, when they got trapped in the virtual space forever. They want revenge against Kaiba and are using the oportunity of the virtual reality pods deployed in the museum to trap Yugi, in order to lure Kaiba in.
*   At that point Noah speaks directly to the camera, and we see that Kaiba and Mokuba have their own computer screens hacked by this kid. Noah directly confronts Kaiba, challenging to go there and save his so-called enemy as he knows he is in debt to Yugi for defeating Pegasus.
*   Noah then says to the group that he is stealing something from Kaiba for them to use while they are in the virtual world: his new and renovated duel disk that would allow them to have a duel pretty much anywhere. These virtual duel disks would be just a projection, but would still work like the real ones that Kaiba has been developing in secret.
*   The Big Five then propose a challenge to Yugi and the rest of the group: a Duel Monsters battle within the virtual world. If they win they can get out, but if any of the gang loses a duel to one of The Big Five, the winner will gain control of their body and escape to the real world while the loser's mind will be trapped in the virtual world.
*   They have introduced a new set of rules where each duelist has a "Deck Master", a special card that acts as a main monster for them. The Big Five make a simple demostration of the rules, explaining that if a Duelist's Deck Master is destroyed then that would mean losing the duel in the spot. To put the odds in their favor, the Big Five declare that they will be dueling anyone currently present before them, not only the duelists, so this includes Honda, Anzu and Shizuka.
*   Kaiba is pissed off and tries to hack his way into that server in order to cut off their plans, but Noah declares that it is futile and that the amount of redundancies are countless. He has been planning this for a long time.
*   The group protests, specially Jonouchi in defense of his sister, but the Big Five just laugh and splits them all, sending each of them to a different location within the virtual world, as the transmission cuts off.
*   Mokuba asks his brother what is he going to do. Kaiba orders Mokuba to stay there while he deals with it. Without wasting much time, he grabs something from a drawer, walks onto the virtual pods within Kaiba Corporation and go into the virtual world despite his brother's protests. Mokuba, after seeing his brother jump in, decides to ignore his order and go in aswell.

## Episode 48 - Deck Master - Deepsea Warrior

![](/img/storyimg/ep0048.jpg)

---

*   Everyone is dropped through virtual tunnels and ends up isolated in a different place of the virtual world: Yugi arrived to some sort of swamp, Kaiba ended up in a forest, Mokuba in a beach, Jonouchi in the outside of what seems to be a manor, Anzu in a canyon, Honda in a library, Otogi in a fancy hall, and Shizuka near a pond.
*   Noah sends Oshita from the Big Five to challenge Yugi, but since he doesn't have a body he takes the form of "Deepsea Warrior" which will serve as his Deck Master. Once there he challenges Yugi, who first needs to build his deck from a projection of virtual cards. Going through the cards, Yugi is about to choose Dark Magician as his Deck Master but Kuriboh emerges from the card on his own. He protests that he didn't choose that card but Oshita declares that once chosen it cannot be changed, so Yugi decides to trust in Kuriboh who seems happy.
*   They **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-48---oshita-vs-yugi)** in the swamp, quickly getting used to the duel disks, and even as Oshita boasts his knowledge of philosophy and warfare to deplete Yugi's reserves, in the end Yugi with the help of Kuriboh manages to win. When he does, a door shows up floating in the water.
*   Meanwhile, Honda finds Otogi as they actually were in the same building. They try to get out but the hallways seem to be endless. On a different area, Anzu is being chased by some monsters and falls unconscious.

## Episode 49 - Duel on Ice - Anzu is Targeted

![](/img/storyimg/ep0049.jpg)

---

*   Anzu wakes up in a cave, having been kidnapped by a group of Cyclops. She discovers they plan on cooking her, but she is rescued when a penguin drops a vine down a hole in the cave ceiling for her. After escaping, the Cyclops chase her over a wooden bridge, which collapses under their weight. The giants fall to their deaths while Anzu barely holds on.
*   Meanwhile Honda and Otogi have managed to break free from that place by using axes and maces to destroy the hallway. They emerge outside where they find Shizuka running from a dangerous beast, and they manage to save her.
*   Mokuba wanders in the beach and finds a working TV in the middle of the sand that is still on. It shows his brother walking through the forest. Suddenly a door shows up in front of Kaiba, who opens it and finds himself in a vivid picture of the orphanage that he and Mokuba used to live in.
*   Anzu stands up and finds the penguin that saved her, who leads her to a raft which takes her to a beach filled with more penguins. One of them in particular can speak, and reveals to be Otaki, another of the Big Five, in the form of "Nightmare Penguin". He challenges her to a duel in the icy environment, and when she rans away she ends up trapped in a block of ice surrounded by water.
*   Anzu gets to build her deck and choose her deck master, and she picks Fire Sorcerer to be the one. As they **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-49---otaki-vs-anzu)** in there, he seems to get the advantage and as he deals damage to her she starts to become encased in ice. Pulling her last strength, Anzu manages to turn around the duel in the end and win, marking a second victory over the Big Five members.

---

## Episode 50 - Gamble to Victory

![](/img/storyimg/ep0050.jpg)

---

*   Noah is shown watching in multiple screens where everyone is. He lures Kaiba into the orphanage and displays a projection of his life there, while Mokuba watches on that TV in the sands. They watch the day that Kaiba challenged Gozaburo to a chess match and won. Gozaburo had agreed to adopt the brother if he lost. The scene changes and this time it is showing their life with Gozaburo. Kaiba was forced to overwork in his studies.

## Episode 51 - A Man's Path

![](/img/storyimg/ep0051.jpg)

---

*   Kaiba (and Mokuba) are still seeing the scenes from the past. Seto wonders who this kid actually is, why is he so obssessed with him and surpassing him, and who may be behind all of this, as he doesn't think that Noah is capable of pulling a plan like this on his own.
*   Honda and the other two find the next member of the Big Five waiting for them in the hangar they just appeared into. It is Ota in the form of his "Machine Sergeant" Deck Master. He plans to duel Shizuka, but Honda and Otogi (knowing her inexperience with dueling) negotiate with him and agree to a 3v1 **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-51---shizuka--honda--otogi-vs-ota)**.
*   They build their decks and pick their respective Deck Masters (Raremetal Knight for Honda, Swift-Strike Black Ninja for Otogi and Goddess of the Mind's Eye for Shizuka). During the duel she makes a lot of mistakes that Ota takes advantage of, and while Honda and Otogi try to cover for her it ends up leading to a really difficult decision. Making the ultimate move, Honda sacrifices his Deck Master to save her, but that means that he has lost the duel. The duel then continues in a 2v1. Devastated by this, Shizuka ends up gathering enough courage to get an advantage and, together with Otogi, avenge Honda by defeating Ota.
*   As the duel was happening, Jonouchi, Yugi and Anzu had been walking through a cave looking for them. They finally manage to arrive and cheer Shizuka in her final turn. The duel ends with a bittersweet victory, because Honda has been defeated and thus has lost his body to the Big Five.

*   Honda's mind has somehow found a way to a robot monkey card, and he has taken that form. His friends are now going through what seems to be a city when they encounter Kaiba. Suddenly, Ota in Honda's body shows up and attacks Seto with a steel bar, but he is stopped by monkey-Honda. He escapes in a motorcycle and Seto pursues him in another one.
*   Even though monkey-Honda cannot speak, Shizuka picks him up and convince the others to take him with them as he helped Kaiba. They try to follow Kaiba and find a pickup truck. At some point monkey-Honda flips a switch on his head that allows him to speak normally, but Jonouchi and Otogi dont trust him yet.
*   Kaiba is stopped by Daimon on the road, crashing his motorbike, and the two of them begin a **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-52---daimon-vs-kaiba)**. Like his associates, Daimon is in the form of his Deck Master, but he has disguised it with clothes, a hat, and sunglasses. Kaiba does not attempt to learn his identity, and only when Leichter uses his ability to destroy Trap Cards, it is revealed to be "Jinzo".
*   Meanwhile, Mokuba finds himself in an unfamiliar room. The TV in the sand disappeared and everything was replaced with what he sees now. Noah is in that room, they talk for a bit and they both watch Seto's duel.
*   During their duel, Daimon reveal how Kaiba managed to end up being who he is, and some of the things he did to become the chairman of Kaiba Corporation. Kaiba declares that he is going to purge the Big Five once and for all, and with a display of pure strength he pulls off the win.

Following the cries of a baby, they find themselves inside a manor a framed portait of Noah posing with Gozaburo. Another door takes them to a projection revealing that Noah is Gozaburo's son, and he originally planned to adopt Seto in order to motivate Noah in his studies. Yugi gives Kaiba the portrait of Noah and Gozaburo, who disregards the entire story as false because the photo was dated six years previously, but Noah has not aged since then.
*   At Noah's place, Mokuba tries to reason with him, believing that he is the son of Gozaburo and therefore like a brother to him. Noah is not interested in him that much, but Mokuba challenges him to a **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-53---noah-vs-mokuba)** in order to make his feelings reach him. He is no match for Noah and is defeated, but Noah ends the duel with a pensive look on his face.

Joey summons five monsters to stall them and they attempt to escape in the truck.

At one point, Noah shows a sphere in the sky to Kaiba, revealing that it contains a digitized version of his brain and has kept him alive in virtual reality after he died in a car accident six years previously.
*   Noah reveals that when his mind was digitized, he was able to rapidly gain knowledge from Gozaburo's computer database until he was more intelligent than any human. A flashback reveals that when Noah first existed in virtual reality, he was often visited by his father, who gave him a town to live in and people to interact with. Noah soon grew frustrated with the limitations of the world so he began to reprogram it. He told Gozaburo his idea of improving the virtual world by connecting it to networks around the real world. When he asked Gozaburo if he was capable of taking over Kaiba Corporation, Gozaburo refused to discuss it. Without Noah's knowledge, he started to focus more on the newly adopted Seto and Mokuba.
*   After a hard fought duel, Kaiba manages to find an opening and defeats Noah.

## Episode 57 - Darkness of the Kaiba Family

![](/img/storyimg/ep0057.jpg)

---

*   Noah realizes that he'd lost because Seto has the courage to never give up, even when the situation seemed hopeless. Left alone in the Virtual World for six years after his accident, Noah felt that his father, Gozaburo, forgot him upon Seto's arrival into the Kaiba family. Because of this, he blames his stepbrother for robbing him of his birthright of ownership of the family company, and he intended to take revenge by escaping to the real world.
*   Moments later, Gozaburo Kaiba reveals his own virtual self to Noah and the gang and explains the story behind Kaiba's adoption: initially, Kaiba was to become a replacement body for Noah's digitized mind, but Gozaburo later determined that Seto's mind was perfectly good and realized that even though Noah would have a body, his son would never truly grow up and would always remain a spoiled brat in spirit. Gozaburo turned his attention toward training Kaiba into becoming the businessman who would someday inherit Kaiba Corporation.
*   Kaiba's takeover of the company ruined Gozaburo's plans. Humiliated, he uploaded his own mind into Noah's virtual world and was never seen in the real world again. As the mastermind behind the events drawing Kaiba and the gang to the virutal world, Gozaburo unveils his new plan: to trap everyone's minds in the real world into Virtual Reality using the global networking idea that Noah had conceived six years previously. In being uploaded to the virtual world, the population of Earth would essentially become immortal, and Gozaburo would be the powerful ruler of the new world. Noah realizes for the first time that, although Gozaburo promised to help him claim his birthright when he uploaded his own mind to the virtual world, he was actually just using Noah and The Big Five all along.
*   Noah leads everyone to a door which he claims is the exit. Instead of entering the real world, they each become trapped in their memories until they realize they've been tricked and return to a virtual Domino City. Noah teleports away and takes Mokuba to the virtual Domino City arcade where the real exit is. He takes possession of Mokuba's body (given that he defeated him before) and escapes to the real world.
*   Seeing right through Noah's mind games, Kaiba heads through the streets of Gozaburo's virtual Domino City for Kaiba Corporation and finds his biological father in the President's office. He orders Gozaburo to shut down this virtual world and release everyone, but he replies that Seto must earn his freedom and challenges him to a **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-57---gozaburo-vs-kaiba)**. To remind his adoptive son of the painful moment he'd experienced when he dueled Yugi, who'd achieved the impossible by summoning Exodia in their first duel, Gozaburo reveals that he is using an Exodia Deck.
*   Meanwhile Yugi and his friends are fighting an army of duel monsters. Noah has escaped to the real world in Mokuba's body and moves towards Seto's pod, planning to unplug it right and there to kill him. But he suddenly has a change of heart when he remembers the way Mokuba considered Noah his brother during their duel, despite the way he had been treated. Noah rushes back to try to help everyone escape, pointing to the location of the exit door, as the duel monsters keep spawning and start to become an insurmountable threat to the gang.
*   The group manage to escape to the real world thanks to Noah, and luckily Honda wakes up in his real body.
*   Kaiba wins his duel, and when Gozaburo turns into a red monster and tries to escape in Kaiba's body by force, he activates a small device he has brought with him to this virtual world, one that starts to delete everything from the inside. Noah, in Mokuba's body, climbs back inside the pod and reenters the virtual world. He returns his body back to Mokuba and the two say goodbye as Noah sends Mokuba back to the real world. Noah then traps Gozaburo, saving Seto, and as the place selfdestructs, Kaiba makes his escape.

## Episode 58 - The Man from Egypt

![](/img/storyimg/ep0058.jpg)

---

*   Back at the museum the group gets out of the pods and find that Rebecca and her grandfather are also there. Sugoroku had called them in after the machines malfunctioned. Rebecca, a genius with computers, was able to eventually monitor them inside the virtual world and was trying to find a way for them to exit safely but they beat her to it.
*   Professor Yoshimori (Sugoroku's friend who works at the museum) ensures that the room is locked out from other visitors and states that they will need to get in contact with Kaiba Corporation to ensure it is safe before opening it to the public. Suddenly, Mokuba himself gets in contact with him on the phone and says that they will be taking the pods out of there for the time being.
*   They all start talking about what happened in the virtual world with Rebecca and the others. After a while, Arthur explains that he actually came to the city to see this exhibition in the first place, to which Yoshimori replies that he considers it a great honor given that Arthur is a world renowned archaeologist, known for being the one who discovered a year ago what is rumoured to be Atlantis (a claim that is still in dispute, but impressive nonetheless). Yoshimori also mentions that Ms. Ishizu will be coming soon to the city with some really important pieces of the exhibition, and that they should not miss a second visit once she arrives.
*   Meanwhile, Kanekura (the curator of the museum) is shown to be interested in the Millennium Puzzle and is watching them from afar with another man. The man thinks the Millennium Puzzle looks great and wants to buy it, Kanekura whispers to the man that they'll do business in his office.
*   A man (Shadi) is shown walking through the city, invisible and intangible. A bit of a flashback is shown from him, and an internal monolog about him seeing Pegasus in a coma on a hospital bed, with his Millennium Eye removed, and completely unresponsive. He regrets failing to find his attacker. He arrives at the museum and at the very same moment that group is walking outside, thanking Yoshimori for the visit and saying goodbye.
*   Shadi (invisible to all) sees Yugi and his Millennium Puzzle in the distance and believes that's fate that they have met there once again. But first he has something else to do.
*   Kanekura is in his office when suddenly Shadi shows up and judges him with the Millennium Scale. They **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-58---shadi-vs-kanekura)** in a mind puzzle game, a Shadow Game, and Shadi finds him guilty of greed, evil thoughts and attempting to cash on egyptian relics, the judgment is death.

## Episode 59 - Desperate Situation!

![](/img/storyimg/ep0059.jpg)

---

*   The following day after school, on the TV, Sugoroku and Yugi hear about reporters on the museum talking about the curator's death. They say it was apparently a heart attack but people are already talking about an egyptian curse. Sugoroku wants to go see Yoshimori at the University since this must be hard for him, but he can't close his store just yet because he is waiting an important delivery of games, so he asks Yugi if he can go see him now that the school is over. He says that he will join him later as soon as he can receive the delivery. Sugoroku calls Yoshimori to let him know in advance.
*   Yugi leaves the store and bumps into Anzu and Jonouchi who have just heard the news of Kanekura's death. Jonouchi is certain this is a curse and wants to go with them to see Yoshimori since the Professor was nice to them the other day and they are all worried about him. They quickly call Honda but he is stuck at school with club activities so he apologizes he can’t be there.
*   Meanwhile Shadi shows up to Yoshimori at his office and uses his Millennium Key (also known as Millennium Ankh) to look into his mind before judging him with the Scales. In his mind he sees that his heart is cluttered with obsessions from the past and that he neglected his family for his job. He also briefly sees Yoshimori’s brother dying by falling out of a window. The darkness of the room represents the anxiety and fear of death given the recent events, but he also sees hope. That hope is represented by Sugoroku and the group going there. Shadi is once again surprised to see Yugi present and decides that before killing this man he will use him to properly test Yugi, as he will face harder challenges in the future, specially from the one who stole the millennium eye and is still on the loose. Shadi redecorates Yoshimori's soul room, turning him into a zombie.
*   Yugi, Jonouchi and Anzu get to the University and meet with Yoshimori but he starts attacking them. Yugi is surprised to see Shadi appear in the professor’s office but he seems to be the only one who can see him. When it looks like Jonouchi is overpowering Yoshimori, Shadi brainwash Anzu and makes her go running to the roof. Yugi runs after her but cant catch her. When he gets to the roof she is already on the trap Shadi made for her, so they both **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-59---shadi-vs-yugi)** in their minds with the power of their millennium items, while still being aware of their surroundings in the real world.
*   Meanwhile Jonouchi escapes through a window from the demented professor and climbs up, where he sees Anzu. He tries to save her and they do it when Yugi defeats Shadi and the ankh clears Anzu mind. The professor climbed through the window after Jonouchi but the boy places the Ankh upon him and he is too released from the soul's redecoration, coming back to himself.
*   Defeated, Shadi leaves and mutters to himself that he is now sure without a doubt not only that Yugi is the proper holder of the Millennium Puzzle, but that he is stronger than what he initially thought.
*   They all go back to the professor's office and after being sure that he is okay they go to the university's cafeteria to buy something to eat or drink, while the professor stays on his office resting for a bit from the crazy incident.
*   Taking advantage that Yugi and his friends are temporarily absent, Shadi appears once again and tells Yoshimori that he still needs to be **[judged](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-59---shadi-vs-yoshimori)**, rising the scales upon him.
*   Sugoroku is walking down the street, finally getting to the University building when there is a sound of glass shattering. He sees his friend Yoshimori falling through the window and screams in horror. Shadi looks to the professor in the ground one last time and leaves, disappearing in the air. The silhouette of a young girl is shown in the door behind where Shadi just was, covering her mouth in horror after seeing what just happened there.

*   The group visit Yoshimori at the hospital and meet his wife, young son and niece. The niece, who is the same girl that saw what Shadi did to his uncle, and goes by the name of Fizdis, stares at Yugi's millennium puzzle but says nothing. Yoshimori is out of danger but he is in a coma and he may never wake up. While leaving, Yugi wonders why Shadi's method are so drastic and is unsure if its friend or foe, convinced that it was him who attacked Yoshimori when they were absent.
*   A couple of days later Ishizu arrives to the city and starts making the final preparations for her egyptian exhibition. Shortly after she gives a press conference on TV about the museum, while also briefly mentioning the unfortunate events that occured there recently. She hopes for the best recovery for the professor and also encourage people to come visit, as its a one-in-a-lifetime experience to see all these relics for the first time.
*   Yugi is shown walking on the streets. Anzu sees and calls him but he doesnt hear her. She stumbles upon a store with tv screens that is transmitting Ishizu's conference, and is interested in her. Mokuba is also watching the conference in his place too, and mentions it to Seto, who doesnt care. At that very moment Ishizu herself personally calls Seto on the phone and invites him to meet with her at the Museum, with the promise of finding some rare cards.
*   Kaiba and Ishizu meet at the Museum at night and she shows him an interesting tablet which surprises him. Ishizu uses the powers of her Millennium Necklace (also known as Millennium Tauk) to show him a vision of the past, of Ancient Egypt and of a **[battle](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-60---priest-seto-vs-pharaoh-servant)** between a priest and a servant of the Pharaoh.
*   She then talks about the Ghouls and the God Cards, explaining what they are and what’s her true goal in the city. She gives Kaiba “The Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk” and instructs him on creating a tournament so that the other two Egyptian Gods can be found. She also states she will entrust Kaiba with "Obelisk" for the tournament but that he will give it to her back. When he asks why would she trusts him that much she just says that she does. Kaiba leaves the place not caring that much for the egyptian stuff, but laughing about having obtained such a powerful card and getting excited about the prospect of the tournament.

## Episode 61 - The Shattered Millennium Puzzle

![](/img/storyimg/ep0061.jpg)

---

*   Yugi has exchanged the brown rope for a chain in order to keep his Millennium Puzzle as safe as possible. His other self explains that this change is vital since the Millennium Puzzle connects the two, and he also senses that fate has more in store for them, specially after Shadi's recent moves.
*   Later that day Yugi and Anzu come across a fortune teller who Yugi believes can help him see what is in the future for him. The fortune teller asks for a personal item and suggest the Millennium Puzzle which, once in hand, he steals it. Yugi runs after him and Anzu go asking for help. She runs into Bakura and explain the situation, and then keeps running looking for Jonouchi and Honda. Bakura (once alone) uses his Millennium Ring to look after the Millennium Puzzle saying that Yugi must be the one that holds the puzzle, and that anyone who makes themselves his enemy become Bakura’s enemy as well.
*   Yugi follows some arrows on the walls in the street and catches to the fortune teller in an old building that unexpectedly has a Duel Ring in it. The Millennium Puzzle has been locked to the duel ring and the fortune teller challenges Yugi to a duel. Even if they are apart Yugi and the other Yugi (that resides in the Puzzle) can still comunicate, but he says that he must not use the power of the puzzle since he feels that there is something strange, someone else besides this man trying to find his true identity. Yugi must have this duel alone.
*   Meanwhile Bakura found the track and starts swapping the arrow signs to confuse anyone else following him. The **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-61---keith-vs-yugi)** starts, and Yugi notices that the fortune teller has a lot of machine cards. He guesses that he is Bandit Keith, and is right, but Keith is now the host of someone else that is controlling his mind: Marik Ishtar.
*   Meanwhile Anzu finds Honda and Jonouchi and they go searching for Yugi but get confused by the arrows.
*   Bakura watches the duel for a bit and senses that another millennium item is in play. He uses his ring to break Marik’s control. Keith is free for a moment and resists when Marik’s tries to regain control of him. Marik feels that his power is decreasing with every moment. Keith believes that all of this is because of the millennium puzzle so he smashes it to pieces. Bakura jumps and knocks Keith out. He and Yugi gather the millennium pieces and Bakura uses his power to seal a part of himself inside a piece of the puzzle. He then leaves lying that he’ll try to find Anzu and the rest to tell them that Yugi is safe, in reality his mission was completed when he manipulated the puzzle so he has no interest in searching for the others.
*   Yugi stays a while because he can’t pull the puzzle out of the arena. Suddenly, Keith wakes up and when Marik tries to control his mind again (with some of the small control he still has, that is still rapidly dwindling) he starts smashing everything around him, knocking some fuel and starting a fire. Yugi tries to get the Puzzle out but he cant.
*   The fire is extending quickly and Jonouchi and the rest see the smoke from a distance and follow it to the building. Anzu goes asking for help once again and Jonouchi and Honda brute force the entry. Keith runs past them escaping from the fire. They find Yugi meddling with the puzzle pieces and actually completing it once again before passing out. They try to get the puzzle out and cant, but they hear the voice of the other yugi suggesting to pull the chain with the pipes and they do, saving Yugi and the puzzle from the fire, just as firefighters arrive.
*   After that, Yugi is shown on a hospital bed recovering from the fire and talking with his friends about the puzzle. Anzu goes to bring the others a drink and ponders about the existence of the other Yugi.

*   A few days later, at school, Jonouchi triumphally **[defeats](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-62---otogi-vs-jonouchi)** Otogi with his own deck and makes a little dance. Yugi asks Otogi about his contact with Pegasus, and he tells him that he is in contact with a representant, not Pegasus directly, but everything appears to be going well. The game is expanding worldwide and there are multiple companies making contracts to create their own cards.
*   Yugi is shown at home at night, with the puzzle, pondering about what happened with Keith. He talks with his other self about it. At the same time Anzu falls sleep on her desks and has a dream about the other Yugi in an egyptian building, before waking up startled. Back to Yugi, he asks his other self who he is and they both talk about it. Yugi doesnt want to part ways with him though, and cries a bit about that.
*   The following day, Honda and Jonouchi are at school talking about the upcoming Shizuka's operation. Yugi asks Anzu if she is free that weekend to hang out with the other Yugi, and he sets the date for that sunday at domino station at 10 in the morning as he runs into the rain covering his head with his school bag.
*   Tricked by his other half, the other Yugi is a bit awkward at first but then he relax and spends a fun day with Anzu. At one point, while drinking something, she asks if he wants to go to the egyptian museum now that it has all the stuff they couldn't see before. He is a bit reticent to this at first. They hang out the entire day, go to the park, see a movie, and buy some card packs.
*   They end up meeting a guy named Johnny Steps on a dance video machine and Anzu beats him dancing. He then goes after them and challenge them in “a real game”: duel monsters. Yugi is ready to accept but Anzu accepts for him, saying that she has been practicing a bit.
*   They **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-62---step-johnny-vs-anzu)** and yugi is surprised to see that Anzu holds her up pretty well against him, specially seeing that he’s not a bad duelist at all. At one point she takes a considerable advantage and is about to beat him, so she thanks Yugi for an encouraging comment he gave her. Hearing his name and finally figuring out his looks, Johnny realizes who he is and bails from the duel. But Anzu stops him when he's running away and talks a bit with him, helping reignite his dream on being a dancer and motivating him to keep pushing for his dream and not give up.
*   Hearing that and seeing how she dueled, the other Yugi says that he is ready to see what the Museum may hold for him.

## Episode 63 - The Tablet of Lost Memories

![](/img/storyimg/ep0063.jpg)

*   The night has fallen. Anzu and Yugi go into the Museum and find the old stone tablet depicting a battle between a Pharaoh and a high-ranking Priest: One looks like Yugi while the other looks like Kaiba. They meet Ishizu who gives Yugi some clues about his past. She tells Yugi that, he came to the Museum of his own will and, in doing so, has chosen the "Fate of Fighting". If he wants to get his memories back, there's no other choice but to gather the 7 Millennium Items. Yugi, suspicious, questions on which side is she.
*   She challenges him to a mental **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-63---ishizu-vs-yugi)** using her Millennium Necklace. They have a short mind duel, while Anzu is unaware of what is happening, as the time for them goes way faster because they are dueling with their minds. Ishizu makes some impressive moves on her turn, but quickly surrenders after that, explaining that she has seen how this duel would play out. She calmly replies that she isn't Yugi’s foe, but that she can see a man wielding a new Millennium Item who will show up soon enough in front of Yugi. She adds that Yugi’s battle is for the sake of gaining his memories back and that his Fate will be set in motion soon enough. The rest is for Yugi to confirm with his own eyes.
*   She briefly uses the power of her Millennium Necklace to give both Yugi and Anzu a small vision (much shorter than Kaiba), but in this case a vision of the future: of Yugi fighting a dangerous opponent, and of the millennium rod.
*   Ishizu excuses herself after this, and leaves for the moment. She has an internal monolog about how relieved she feels on finally finding the one her family was looking for so long, but also concerned about what will happen next, now that fate is in motion.

*   After Yugi and Anzu leave the museum they walk around for a bit and meet with Mai in front of the domino station. She has shown up for the announcement for the upcoming tournament (and jokingly teases Anzu for being on a date with Yugi).

*   Becoming aware of this tournament, the holder of the Millennium Rod and leader of the Ghouls sends his Rare Hunters out to Duel and win Rare Cards for him.
*   The following morning after the announcement of Battle City, Bakura appears in front of the Domino Museum. He is being guided by his Millennium Ring which is sensing a millennium item in the proximity. He enters the museum and after walking for a bit sees the ancient stone tablet. Ishizu appears before him and confronts him. Bakura is surprised to know that she’s a millennium item holder, revealing that his host’s father is the actual owner of the museum, much to Ishizu’s surprise. They both face in a mind **[duel](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-64---bakura-vs-ishizu)** with their respective millennium items. The duel ends up being relatively even, with no one being able to get past the other.
*   Suddenly, Shadi shows up and interrupts their mind duel.

*   Shadi has interrupted the duel between Bakura and Ishizu by showing himself and breaking their mental connection. Ishizu is surprised to see him here, and Bakura too. Shadi confronts Bakura accusing him of stealing Pegasus' Millennium Eye, which Bakura confirms laughing maniacally and fully retelling them their mind duels (two duels actually, **[first](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-65---bakura-vs-pegasus)** on episode 28 that Bakura lost but used his power to erase Pegasus' memory of it, and **[then](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-65---bakura-vs-pegasus-1)** on episode 40 that bakura won).
*   He also confirms in front of Ishizu that he killed Shadi with his own hands years ago, and that he has no problem facing him now as a ghost.
*   Bakura states that he is searching for all the millennium items, and points that he still needs the Scale and Ankh as well. Him and Shadi **[face each other](/scrolls/duels-legacy-arc/#ep-65---bakura-vs-shadi)** in a flash of light with their millennium items (Ankh vs Ring). Ishizu runs away in the middle of the bright light and conceals her presence using the Millennium Tauk, saying that she should use it as little as possible now due to there being such a powerful antagonist near her. After the clash, Shadi vanishes too and Bakura mumbles in frustration.
*   Bakura, weakened after those two exchanges, looks into the ancient tablet one final time and retreats saying that he needs to gather strength as he has the feeling something interesting is going to happen in the upcoming days. In his place, the real Bakura recovers control of his own body and wonder what is he doing there.
*   Ishizu is last seen leaving the museum, as she doesn’t feel safe there. Shadi is last seen in a different place, admitting that he cannot defeat Bakura as he is now, and looking at the Scales and the Ankh pondering why he can’t extract their full powers against other millennium items holders, wondering if he’s not worthy anymore now that he’s dead.
