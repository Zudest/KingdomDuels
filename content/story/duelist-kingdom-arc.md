## Episode 1 - The Heart of the Cards

![](/img/storyimg/ep0001.jpg)

---

*   A narrator explains how in Ancient Egypt, when the pyramids were young, ancient Kings played Shadow Games, which erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the world. However a Pharaoh sealed the magic away, imprisoning it in the Millennium Items. Thousands of years later Yugi Muto unlocked the secrets of the Millennium Puzzle infusing him with ancient magical energies. Destiny has chosen Yugi to prevent the return of the Shadow Games, just like the Pharaoh did.
*   At Domino High School, Yugi is teaching his friend, Jonouchi, **[how](/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---yugi-vs-jonouchi)** to play Duel Monsters, while Honda, Anzu and Bakura watch.
*   Yugi takes his friends to see Sugoroku's (his grandfather) shop. The old man reveals that he has an ultra rare card: Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kaiba, a rich kid from school who overheard them talking about it, arrives to the place too and attempts to purchase the card but Yugi's grandfather refuses.
*   Later that night Kaiba calls Yugi asking him to come retrieve his grandfather as he is not feeling well and needs picking up. Kaiba had sent his employees to grab the old man and drag him to his place, where they dueled and he took his Blue-Eyes card.
*   Kaiba welcomes Yugi and his friends at his company and tears apart the card he took from Sugoroku. He explains that he did it because already had 3 Blue-Eyes and didn't wanted for the 4th one to be used against him.
*   Sugoroku leaves in an ambulance but entrust Yugi his own deck. Anzu uses a marker to draw a smiley face symbol of friendship on everyone's hands. She says that even though the ink will wash away, they will always remember the circle of their friendship.
*   Yugi **[confronts](/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-1---kaiba-vs-yugi)** Kaiba in an epic duel using his grandfather's deck. Yugi is overwhelmed and cornered though, as Kaiba is an excellent duelist. Eventually the protagonist manages to draw the five legendary pieces of Exodia, which allow him to win the duel and cleanse the darkness in Kaiba's heart using the power of his Millennium Puzzle.
*   Elsewhere, Pegasus is informed that the uncontested champion Seto Kaiba has been defeated by someone named Yugi. Pegasus smiles and his golden left eye flashes.

He now has eight Star Chips, meaning he only needs two more to become a finalist.
*   As the group approaches the cave's exit, Keith's gang blocks the entrance with a large boulder, too heavy for any of them to budge. As punishment for losing, Keith beats up his henchmen and takes all of their Star Chips, getting a total of ten.

## Episode 22 - Duel of Destiny! Yugi vs Kaiba

![](/img/storyimg/ep0022.jpg)

---

*   Yugi and the group emerge from the underground tunnel and arrive outside Pegasus Castle. Anzu thinks about how Yugi often switches from a gentle and caring nature to a more forceful, slightly colder and unfriendlier one. She concludes there must be two Yugis after remembering his Duel with Bakura.
*   She then recalls some time ago when she was working part-time at Burger World and she feared that Yugi and Jonouchi would reveal this to the school when they visited one day (as it was against the school rules to have a part-timme job). She admitted she was working there to raise money to travel to New York to study dance, and was shocked to find they were encouraging her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a pervert mugger with a camera, and was knocked out unconscious for a moment. She was rescued by Yugi who challenged the mugger with Duel Monster cards and Mind Crushed him. Although she was a bit hazy she remembered the confident attitude of Yugi at that time.
*   As the group climb up the stairs to Pegasus Castle they encounter Kaiba, who challenges Yugi. Yugi accepts and they begin their **[duel](/scrolls/duels-duelist-kingdom-arc/#ep-22-24---kaiba-vs-yugi)** on an open area atop the castle using Kaiba's new-and-improved Duel Disks.

Yugi's Elf Swordsman cuts off one of the dragon's head, and another attack will defeat Kaiba.
*   In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle battlements. It's clear that the force of Yugi's next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him. Kaiba resurrects the dragon head that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi's monster and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move, otherwise he will fall to his death. Yugi and his other self have a conflict over risking Kaiba's life for his grandpa. The-other-Yugi launches the attack anyway, but Anzu runs to him pleading to call off the attack. Yugi regains control of his body and stops the attack just in time. Kaiba then declares an attack and wins.
*   Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is frightened of his other self, who was willing to kill in order to win. He drops to his knees and begins to sob. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi on his weakness, but Anzu tearfully scolds him, saying that he bet his "chip of life" like it was nothing and that he is the true loser because Yugi was willing to protect Kaiba's own life despite the outcome of the duel. Kaiba leaves, having no comeback to her words.

They are soon confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another place.
*   The three wake up in a passageway filled with Egyptian murals and paintings. They enter a room, where two robed men are facing each other while others behind them are chanting. The two robed men reveal stone tablets to each other. One contains a carving of a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" while the other has a "Crawling Dragon". The robed man with "Crawling Dragon" loses and is consumed in green flames, as his monster was weaker than "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". Honda, Anzu and Bakura unintentionally make some noice seeing this, causing the robed men to notice them and surround them. The winning man reveals himself to be Pegasus.
*   Pegasus reveals that the game he just played was one of the Shadow Games that took place in ancient Egypt, an ancient ritual where one's very being is put to the test. He reads Anzu and Honda's minds, to their shock, and explains what his Millennium Eye can do.

## Episode 40 - King of Duelists

![](/img/storyimg/ep0040.jpg)

---

*   Having won the tournament, Yugi is now officially the King of Duelists.
*   Yugi and his friends are running through the castle in order to find Pegasus, so that he will release all the souls that he captured like he promised. Anzu stops for a brief moment because she notices a nearby tower. She notes to her friends that she recognizes that tower as the one she thought that Honda and Bakura went up into before in a dream. She then realizes that was Pegasus's sanctuary and what she remembered was real. Honda agrees too as the memory is coming back to him. They decide to go there.
*   Pegasus is in his private tower and is depressed that he lost against Yugi and the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle. Regardless, he is a man of his word, so he releases the souls of Sugoroku and the Kaiba brothers. Because of this all 3 wake up and regain their senses. Just then, the evil Bakura arrives and gives Pegasus an impromptu tarot reading before challenging him to a Shadow Game using their Millennium Items. Bakura easily defeats Pegasus (who's still exhausted from his Shadow Game with Yugi), and takes his Millennium Eye. Yugi and the gang arrive to see Pegasus unconscious being carried away by his guards. They enter the tower and find Pegasus's diary. Anzu reads from it, and it explains that as a teenager, he met a girl named Cyndia. They were true lovers, but just as they were about to be married, Cyndia got sick and died.
*   Pegasus traveled all over the world trying to get her back. He wound up in Egypt, where he met a man named Shadi, who gave him the Millennium Eye. Thanks to his wish asked to the Eye he got a brief vision of her. Pegasus gets the idea that using the holographic technology of Kaiba Corporation along with the power of the Millennium Items could bring Cyndia back to life. He explains in his diary that this was his reason for hosting the Duelist Kingdom tournament, but the diary ends there.
*   Yugi notices that there are three Soul Prison cards that are blank. That means Pegasus did release the souls of his prisoners like he had promised. As the group leaves, Shadi appears in the stairs using magic and confronts Yugi. Shadi uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi's mind, as that is the power of his item. To his surprise, he finds two chambers in his mind, one for Yugi, and the other for the-other-Yugi. While the former is a nice room full of innocence and toys, the latter is a giant maze filled with trap doors. Shadi enters through several of them before almost falling into an endless void. Luckily, the regular Yugi saves him.
*   In one of the chambers, Shadi and Yugi are walking alongside stone tablets that feature monsters from the actual Duel Monsters game. The "Dark Magician" shows up, who is about to attack them as he thinks they are intruders. Shadi plans to use the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" tablet below them to destroy it, but Yugi talks him out and manages to convince the "Dark Magician" to let him go. Shadi is shocked that Yugi was able to convince the "Dark Magician" that easily, given that the "Dark Magician" is it said to be the most loyal of the ancient Pharaoh's servants. Shadi leaves Yugi's mind, believing he is the one that will save the world from chaos. Before he leaves, Shadi warns Yugi to take great care as the thief that stole the Millennium Eye will go after Yugi's Millennium Puzzle soon.
