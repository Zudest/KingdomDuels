_"The time has finally come, and the group travels to Egypt to help the Pharaoh find the last two Millennium Items so he can recover his memories. As he embarks to his world of memories, we discover that the final foe is a calamity of the ancient past that has been lurking in the shadows since the very beginning, waiting for this moment to wage a final war of light and darkness that will define the fate of the world."_

>**Author's Note**: This arc has three core storylines: The first one is an original story with some elements of the Pyramid of Light movie within it, revolving around the last two Millennium Items and featuring Fizdis which is a videogame exclusive character that i took the liberty to readapt for this story. The second one is the Millennium World, that i wanted to adapt by having actual duels while following the same plot points of the anime (as I felt that the lack of dueling in that season of the anime harmed its reputation for some people, and also because this project is based on adapting everything to the Duelist Kingdom rules). Finally, the third story is about the ceremonial duel and the fantastic closure that it gave to the show.

## Episode 116 - The Ultimate Game

![](/img/storyimg/ep0116.jpg)

---

- After the recent events in America, Pegasus arranges for Yugi and the group to return to Japan. Arthur and Rebecca say goodbye to them in the airport, and Rebecca even hugs Yugi calling him "darling", which irritates Anzu a bit. Arthur asks them to send his greetings to Sugoroku, and ask for him to not do anything reckless like the old days.
- A couple of days later, the four of them are having a fun **tag-duel** at school that ends after a mistake by Honda that makes Jonouchi jump on him. As they all laugh, the Other Yugi recalls about his talk with Anzu regarding the Wicked Avatar card: He was worried about her having that card, and even asked her to lend him but once she did he couldn't felt evil at all in there. That was a relief to both Yugis, as they were uncertain after everything they went through.
- That night, Ishizu calls Yugi and tells him that they finally found the place where Shadi and the last two Millennium Items should be hiding, which is in an abandon ruin colloquially called "Pyramid of Light". Having confirmed that, she says that she can get him and his friends plane tickets so they can come to Egypt to find the truth about the memories of the Pharaoh.
- Yugi agrees and tells his friends, so they all start to make preparations. Among them, Anzu is worried about what would it mean for the group (and for her) once the Pharaoh recover his memories. Will he forget them? Is he (just as Ishizu told her back in Battle City) going to leave to the place where his soul belongs?
- Two nights before the flight, as Yugi is making his backpack, Sugoroku tells him about his time in Egypt in the 1960's, on how he discovered the Millennium Puzzle: He was guided by two brothers, Ahmet and Mushara, to the "Valley of the Kings" where pharaoh rest. At the time of his visit, over 60 tombs had been discovered but no one had dared enter the inner chambers of the Nameless Pharaoh's tomb. The only person who did and survived was driven mad always repeating the phrase "the Dark Game" over and over. His deal with the two guides was simple: they would lead him to the place, and he will lead them to the treasure. He was fine with it because we wasn't doing it for any treasure but rather for the challenge of facing the "Ultimate Game": he had made a personal vow that if he were to lose that game he would quit gambling and wear overalls for the rest of his life.
- As they went through the tomb they found a variety of trapped rooms that Sugoroku managed to solve one after the other. First it was a room with needle-spitting snake statues. Then it was a closed room with a statue of Horus and a device that required him to use tar and fire to uncover an "invisible ink" tablet. 
- The third room was a narrow maze-like corridor that crossed a large chasm, and it was filled with statues armed with scimitars that attacked on movement. At this point a trap activated and the guides panicked, prompting the elder Ahmet to threaten him with a gun. Sugoroku figured out that the statues would not move if the traveler "showed respect", which in ancient egyptian ways meant putting your left food forward (as your heart is on the left side of the body). By doing this, they managed to cross the room but the younger of the two guides, Mushara, panicked and fell to the chasm.
- The fourth and final room had a bridge made of stone tablets with monster designs on it, with the warning that "cowards' souls will be eaten by specters but courageous ones will be shown the way". As he crossed the bridge, Sugoroku was shot in the back by Ahmet and wounded. However, as the guide crossed the bridge himself a monster sensed his fear and swallowed him alive. The spirit of the Pharaoh himself then helped Sugoroku from his predicament, saying that he was "waiting for him, for Siamun", so that he could retrieve the Millennium Puzzle.
- Ater telling the story, Sugoroku says to himself that as he was injured he brought the puzzle straight back, but wonders if Yugi, as the one who solved the puzzle, could uncover hidden rooms in that place if he ever goes there. He then says to Yugi that he will be tested in Egypt as he has the spirit of the Pharaoh within, but he should never give up during those trials.
- The following morning, Yugi wakes up to find that his grandpa has left. There is a note for him, written in a rush. Apparently Sugoroku had to make an urgent trip to Egypt and hopes to meet him there in a couple of days. Confused, Yugi talks about this with his friends in school but no-one is really sure what to think about it.
- Meanwhile, in the egyptian desert, Sugoroku is in a car traveling near the Pyramids. The driver is a young lady, and actually an acquaintance of him. She is Fizdis, the niece of professor Yoshimori.

## Episode 117 - The Dark Spirit on the Move

![](/img/storyimg/ep0117.jpg)

---

- Bakura is running in the rain at night running from something. He seeks shelter in a nearby church, but all candles light up on their own and a voice speaks to him telling that running is futile and that he has a role to fulfil. Then, the spirit of the Millennium Ring possess Bakura once again, even if he doesn't have the ring physically with him. He says that now that the pharaoh is going to Egypt, his plan can finally be set in motion. The pharaoh will get the 7 Millennium Items without a doubt, but Bakura still needs the secret "eight key" to open the "door of the realm of the dead", a key that Marik Ishtar knew about but didn't get to disclose to him. It's surely hidden in the Pharaoh's "World of Memories". 
- Meanwhile, Yugi is sleeping at home when Haga and Ryuzaki break into his room and grab the bag containing all of the gathered Millennium Items along with the Puzzle box that has the God Cards. They run off and rummage into the bag, taken aback by the stuff inside, as they wanted to get the God Cards for themselves, not those golden objects.
- Suddenly, the Millennium Ring flyis towards someone's hand: Bakura! When questioned if he seeks the God Cards too, he merely replies that it'd be bothersome if they were to be stolen right now. He quickly **defeats them**, just in time to see Yugi arriving to the scene.
- Bakura scolds him for almost letting them run off with the God cards and the Millennium Items, as he tosses the bag to him. Yugi realizes that this is the evil Bakura once again, as he is wearing the ring. He then also tosses his own Ring, telling him that he will need all seven items for his journey to Egypt. Yugi wonders how much that evil Bakura knows about the Millennium Items, and questions what will happen when once they're gathered. Bakura replies that he will help him get all seven. At this point the other Yugi comes out and demands to know his intentions. Bakura acknowledges being the same as him: a soul sealed in the Millennium Ring for thousand of years, and that he has forgotten his past as well, but he knows that the answer may be in the pharaoh's World of Memories. He suggest settling their pending score there, in the "Ultimate Dark Game", and laughs as he leaves.
- Hours later, at Kaiba Corporation, Seto Kaiba is working extra hours in his office when the light goes out and Bakura shows up on his computer's monitor. He lifts an unconscious Mokuba and throws him to the ground, taunting Kaiba to a duel. Kaiba goes to the roof, to his Apex Arena, where he finds Mokuba's unconscious body. He sets him apart and the **duel** begins.
- As they clash, it's clear that they are evenly matched but after a monster from Bakura called "Diabound" manages to face "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", Bakura smiles and says that his job there is done. As the dawn begins to rise, Bakura announces that he should be going, ending the duel without a victor. He tells Kaiba that Yugi is going to Egypt, and that he too should be there if he wants to learn more about the bond he shares with his Blue-Eyes White Dragon.
- At the airport, Yugi and his friends depart to Egypt. When they arrive they meet Ishizu, Marik and Rishid who welcome them. Anzu takes the opportunity at the airport to buy a small cartouche and give it as a gift to the Other Yugi. She explains that in ancient Egypt the Pharaoh's had their names engraved in objects like these. Once the Pharaoh rediscovers his real name he can then engrave it on the pendant, so that he may never forget it again. The Other Yugi is touched by Anzu's gift, and puts the pendant around his neck.

## Episode 118 - Chasing a Ghost

![](/img/storyimg/ep0118.jpg)

---

- Sugoroku and the girl arrive to the supposed location of the "Pyramid of Light" after a couple days of searching.
- In a flashback we learn about her. She is Fizdis, the niece of professor Yoshimori, the friend of Sugoroku that was brainwashed by Shadi to attack Yugi and his friends some time ago. That night, after the events involving Yugi's duel with him, Shadi showed up at Yoshimori's office and judged him, resulting in Yoshimori falling through a window and rushed to a hospital were he was put into a coma ever since. This whole scene was seen by Fizdis, and had shaken her to her core.
- The eye symbol on the Millennium Scale was imprinted on her memory that night. As Yugi and the rest went to visit the professor at the hospital back then, she once again saw that eye symbol on Yugi's pendant, but the boy seemed clueless so she didn't push on the matter. It was only after the shock of those first few days that she started connecting the dots and recognizing the pattern of that golden eye more and more.
- Her father was a photographer who had died a couple of years ago after also being thrown out of a window (although the official explanation had been that it was a suicide, she never believed that). Fizdis found out that his father employer also used to have that symbol on his prosthetic golden eye, as he was a man called Pegasus J. Crawford. Unfortunately he had been in a coma for a while, so she was out of luck there. A bit later, digging some classified information, she found out that her father had accompanied Pegasus to Egypt and returned with photographies of something called "egyptian gods". Not long after that he had died.
- Researching even more, she started to see that golden eye in ancient egyptian murals and studies, and when her TV screen showed Ishizu Ishtar promoting her egyptian exhibition in the city, and she was wearing a necklace with that very same symbol, she went to find her. In the Museum they talked in length. She told Ishizu all about her and how her uncle had been sent to a psychiatric facility and was a danger to himself and others after that horrible night, and that she wanted to help him. But while Ishizu explained to her everything regarding the Millennium Items, she also said that she couldn't help her as the madness should be lifted by the one who gave the punishment, meaning Shadi.
- That was a dead end, and months passed from that day, until recently when Fizdis got a call from Ishizu herself. Ishizu had told her that she hadn't forgotten about her story, and that they had found Shadi's wearabouts. Fizdis asked about it, offering her help, but Ishizu had refused, asking her to leave this matter to her and to "the boy chosen by fate".
- Sugoroku remembered Fizdis as a cheerful young woman, but after her uncle's accident she had changed. A fire burned in her soul now, and he was taken aback when she knocked on his door late at night, with tears in her eyes. After she explained everything to him, she had begged for his help and he couldn't say no. Fizdis had rightfully assumed that Ishizu would have told Yugi (who would have told Sugoroku) about Shadi's location, so if Ishizu would not help her find him, she would do it herself. That very night Sugoroku and her departed to Egypt to find Shadi and try to undo the curse.
- Back in the present, Fizdis is in a good mood because she is making progress, and is back to her cheerful self. They have finally found the place and are getting ready to enter. From her bag she pulls out two duel disks and gives one to Sugoroku, telling him that she knows from Ishizu how important the Duel Monster cards are in this world of magic, and that he should be ready for anything that Shadi may attempt to throw at them.
- The two of them enter the ruins. Fizdis wonders why is it called the Pyramid of Light if there isn't any pyramid nearby, but Sugoroku explains that they are actually in the ruins of a small pyramid that was destroyed a long time ago by invaders. 
- As they wander in the ruins they encounter several traps that Sugoroku rapidly identifies and avoids. The deeper they go, the more complex the traps and puzzles start to become until, at one point, actual duel monsters start to show up to stop them. They use their cards to **fight** them and continue advancing. Sugoroku is surprised by her skill, but then remembers that a couple of years ago she had easily dispatched her uncle ten games to zero in a single night, which was surprising to him considering Yoshimori used to spar with Sugoroku himself and was a decent duelist. She replies that she has been practicing a lot recently, specially after learning about the game's origins and how connected they were to this eye symbol.
- As the two of them get past the traps of the pyramid, Shadi is shown near a bridge holding the Millennium Scales and Ankh, one on each hand. As he watches the two intruders in the distance getting closer to his location, he remembers Ishizu's words back in the Kaiba Corporation Blimp, when she asked him if he would relinquish the Millennium Items to the Pharaoh when the time comes. As that date is rapidly approaching, he feels that the two items he holds are getting weaker and weaker every day. He cannot use their powers anymore, and laments that he has failed on his task as a tomb-keeper.

## Episode 119 - The Maze within the Pyramid

![](/img/storyimg/ep0119.jpg)

---

- Ishizu leads the group towards the location of the Pyramid of Light. She tells Yugi that Shadi has been evading her, and she doesn't know why would he do that. The Pharaoh asks if he plans to avoid giving him the two items, and she doesn't want to believe that but his actions lately have been strange. 
- She explains that the Tomb Keepers split into several groups a long time ago: while the Ishtar group kept safe the Millennium Tauk and Rod, alongside the tradition of carving in flesh the message for the Pharaoh, Shadi's group kept tabs on all the other Millennium Items, minus the Puzzle. It would be strange for him to avoid giving him the items at the moment of truth. Marik mutters to himself that he has some pending issues with Shadi.
- As they go inside the ruins they quickly find out several traps and puzzles that require them to use Duel Monsters cards. As they keep advancing they start seeing visions and mirages that confuse the senses. Suddenly certain traps are activated and the groups are separated. Rishid finds himself with Anzu. Honda and Jonouchi start running away from a horde of scarabs. Ishizu almost falls to a pit of spikes but is saved by Marik at the last second. 
- Meanwhile, Sugoroku and Fizdis, who were also exploring the place and advancing through the traps, have been separated aswell. Yugi is alone, and when he opens a door he finds a group of mummies that start to chase him. As he runs, he manages to dodge them and bumps into Fizdis. She recognizes him and he remembers her from the hospital way back. She briefly tells him that she got there with his grandpa, and that she is searching for Shadi without going into too much details.
- As they wander around, Fizdis finds a friendly black dog that comes to her side. Although wary at first, he seems kind so she pets and gives him a bit of food. The dog has a small blue pyramid on his collar but no id tag or anything indicating an owner. She tries to make him leave the place as it would be dangerous, but he stays and starts following her. The other Yugi in his mind seems thoughtful about that piece of jewelry.
- Yugi hears the voices of his friends in one direction towards what seems to be the exit, and Fizdis wishes him well as she keeps going deeper into the ruins. Yugi tries to ask her to wait, as he also is searching for Shadi, but she presses on.
- Sugoroku suddenly encounters the spirits of Ahmet and Mushara, the two brothers that were his guides a long time ago in Egypt when he found the Millennium Puzzle. Claiming revenge, Ahmet challenges him to a **duel**. As the battle unfolds, they seem to be evenly matched but suddenly a bright golden light shines, dispelling the vision. The duel is stopped as Sugoroku sees that the light comes from Yugi's Millennium Puzzle, and that instead of dueling Ahmet he had been dueling Rishid the whole time. Mushara, who wasn't dueling, was Anzu all along.
- Yugi goes to his grandpa and they embrace. He explains to his grandson all about Fizdis and why is he there in that place.
- On the other end of the ruins, Marik and Ishizu get past a final door and find themselves in a large room, infront of Shadi himself.

---

## Episode 120 - Duel of the Tomb-Keepers

![](/img/storyimg/ep0120.jpg)

---

- The Ishtar siblings confront Shadi. Fizdis arrives to the entrance of that room and hides behind the wall to hear their conversation. Ishizu pleads for him to give the Pharaoh his Millennium Items and help him complete his mission. Shadi objects that he has been fulfilling his mission his whole life, and even continued doing it after his own death. He has been a safekeeper of memories and the protector of the millennium items. He has been loyal to the task. And as a reward, he had been able to use the Scales and Ankh to judge the evil deeds of the world. But now, the two items are weakening. He cannot continue to judge, to fulfil his duty. He fears what may happen when a single person has all seven of them.
- Marik says that he has no right to deny returning the items to the Pharaoh, and he says this from first-hand experience. Ishizu adds that his real duty is not to be a judge, and wonders if he actually enjoys punishing people. Shadi replies that he doesn't, but there is some hesitation in his words. The reality is that now, at the moment of truth, he doesn't feel like he can surrender the items to the Pharaoh himself, he doesn't trust him.
- Marik recriminates him about his actions in the past: after Marik's evil self murdered his own father, Shadi showed up and said that it was the Pharaoh’s revival that led to that fate. That encounter turned Marik's life upside down, burning his soul with the desire to kill the Pharaoh. Why would he say that all those years ago if he was going to refuse to obey his own mission? Why is he backing off after everything he did?
- Shadi replies that he set things in motion in the past, with Marik and also with Pegasus, that led to the creation of the card game that emulate the battle rituals of ancient Egypt. He originally thought that all of that was needed, but now, he regrets it. After the Pharaoh returned to this world, evil things had happened, clearly seen after the shadow games returned. Even The Millennium Items turned to hold a large amount of darkness within them. Only he and his two Millennium Items are fit to properly judge others. It is his mission, he says.
- Ishizu is now sure that there is something wrong with him. Be it that him being a ghost did something to his psyche or something else, he seems to be confused at what his actual role in all of this is. Marik, on the other hand, is angry. Ishizu asks Shadi if he is afraid, and he admits he is. He is afraid of that Pharaoh, and asks her what if the Pharaoh is actually evil? Has the Tomb Keeper's mission been evil from the start? He has delve into the Pharaoh's mind, a maze of endless doors and traps. What is he hiding from them? Ishizu replies that no person is perfect, and even the Pharaoh's most likely to have some darkness in his heart. Maybe Shadi should not have idealized him so much.
- Marik is tired of his nonsense. He knows and trusts the Pharaoh, and Shadi should know too at this point that he is not an evil soul. He steps forward and clash with Shadi in a **duel**, asking her sister to help him.
- Ishizu refuses and leaves, unable to see this, unwilling to fight Shadi. But she is stopped near the door by Fizdis. Ishizu recognizes her, surprised to see her there. Fizdis recriminates why is she not standing against him. She made a promise to her, that she would take care of everything, and is now breaking that promise by leaving. The man who turned his uncle insane is right there, why is she letting him go? Angry, Fizdis challenges her to a **duel** too.
- Shadi and Marik see that on the other end of the room, but must concentrate on their own duel. As the two battles unfold, all duelist play to their very best. Fizdis' anger makes her play more focused, and Ishizu makes uncharacteristic mistakes due to her feeling guilty of her own choices. The girl is able to surpass Ishizu and defeat her, bringing her to her knees as her life points drop to zero. She goes past her with determination and sees that Marik is about to defeat Shadi... but he drives the duel to a draw on purpose at the very last moment.

## Episode 121 - Scales of Judgment

![](/img/storyimg/ep0121.jpg)

---

- Marik was about to defeat Shadi but he tied the duel on purpose. Fizdis saw this and steps forward, asking Marik why would he do that after having the revenge in his hands. She heard all about Shadi's actions when Marik was a kid. Marik simply replies that he just wanted a closure for his past, and to prove to himself that he would not get carried through revenge once again. He then asks Shadi once more to help the Pharaoh, saying that he was also in a dark place but it was the Pharaoh's light that saved him.
- Fizdis then confronts Shadi and demands him just one thing: to heal her uncle. After what he did back then, Yoshimori became first comatose and then mentally ill. Shadi doesn't remember at first, but then realizes who is she talking about, but he just shows no interest, simply saying that he was judged and punished for it. Fizdis asks what was he punished for, but Shadi dismisses her once again. The dog, who was right next to her the whole time, adopts a defensive posture, baring his fangs at Shadi. Fizdis does not accept that reply from him, and challenges Shadi to a **duel**. 
- As the battle unfold, the rest of the group arrives to see the duel. Ishizu and Marik explains to them what is happening. Shadi is shaken after seeing the Pharaoh, but he must continue on with his duel.
- Shadi is about to win, but suddenly the Millennium Scales resonate with her and materialize in her hand, to everyone's surprise, specially Shadi. With them in hand, she regains her strength and discovers a path to victory, managing to turn the duel and defeat Shadi.

---

## Episode 122 - Arrival of Anubis

![](/img/storyimg/ep0122.jpg)

---

- Shadi drops to his knee, surprised at his own defeat. Fizdis steps forward with the scales toward her opponent, still angry at his indifference towards her uncle's fate. As she approaches and the light reaches him, some parts of Shadi's body start to vanish. He shouldn't be able to feel pain, but he does, and he screams. Suddenly, Sugoroku runs trying to stop her, and out of nowhere the Millennium Ankh materializes in his hand, to everyone's shock.
- The two Millennium Items clash in a flash of golden light, and Fizdis and Sugoroku find themselves in a new place. They are alone, and the place is surrounded by a dark purple mist. Sugoroku takes a look at the millennium item in his hand and he seem to understand. They are in her Mind Room. In there, there are several objects related to her family and to herself, reflecting her own dreams of the future. There is a dark corner in the wall filled with moisture and some cracks that are starting to grow towards the rest of her room. From there the dark purple mist is coming out.
- Sugoroku talks to her, explaining that the revenge wont get her what she wants. She replies that is not that she desires revenge, but rather she wants that man to heal her uncle. That's all she wants. But seeing Shadi so indifferent towards the fate of those that he "judged" is just infuriating, and as she say this, the crack on the wall grows slightly more.
- Sugoroku declares that he cannot let her hurt him, even after everything he's done, and challenges Fizdis to a **duel**. The battle goes back and forth but eventually Fizdis overcomes him and defeats him, breaking the illusion and returning them to where they were. It seems that barely a moment has passed as they were dueling in their minds. Sugoroku falls to the ground and Yugi runs to help him.
- Fizdis, however, is calm now. She also helps Sugoroku get up and thanks him for his help. She extends the Scales toward Shadi and the object shines as Shadi is judged for the very first time. She has a vision in which she is wandering a dark maze, barely lit with candles. As she walks forward a putrid smell is felt with more and more intensity. Eventually she enters an open space that has Shadi's corpse, his ankle chained to the wall. His partly-decomposed head moves toward her, like an undead, and she is terrified but manages to stand her ground. As they talk, she begins to understand. He has been slowly growing fear in his heart, ever since he was killed. His soul lingered in the world of the living only due to his duty to the Pharaoh, but even that duty got corrupted out of fear itself. Somewhere along the way he lost his humanity, twisting the mind rooms of people indiscriminately instead of using his powers to make things right. Justice is not only punishment, she says to him.
- Suddenly, a golden light blinds them both and the other Yugi appears, breaking the illusion. He demands for her to stop. She falls back, dropping to the ground, and tries to say that it's okay, that she understand him a bit more now. But the black dog stands in front, protecting her and looking at Yugi. The small blue pyramid in its neck starts to shine, and a dark shadow envelops both the dog and Fizdis.
- A large and muscular man appears in the place that the two of them were. In his neck he wears a larger pendant of the small pyramid that the dog had. He introduces himself as Anubis, although he had many different names in the past. He is an spirit trapped in the "Pyramid of Light", that pendant, which was an object created in the old times of Egypt as a counterpart to the Millennium Puzzle. Anubis says that he was sent there as a counter-measure, to keep in check the actions of the Millennium Items wielders in the land of Egypt until the revival of the Pharaoh. He has done so in the past, and he is about to do it again, as he points at Shadi and states that his soul do not belongs to the world of the living anymore and he should abandon it for the crimes he commited.
- He steps toward him but the group stand in his way. Anubis uses magic to throw them all flying across the room, but Yugi is the only one who manages to resist. Anubis stops in front of him and makes a bow, recognizing him as the Pharaoh. Yugi challenges him to a duel, and Anubis accept, saying that even the Pharaoh himself has crimes to face.

## Episode 123 - The Pyramid of Light

![](/img/storyimg/ep0123.jpg)

---

- Anubis and Yugi clash in an epic **duel**. 
- As they battle, it becomes clear that Anubis knows about actions the other Yugi did way back in the past. They have flashbacks of the time before Duelist Kingdom, where Yugi himself wasn't aware that his other self was taking over his body and punishing wrongdoers in dangerous shadow games. He is aware of how the Other Yugi almost caused Kaiba to fall to his death in Pegasus castle, and how he himself fell to the darkness of the Orichalcos. During the duel Anubis plays a powerful card called "Pyramid of Light" that proves to be a counter to the Egyptian Gods, forcing the other Yugi to fight him without them. He falters and is cornered by the amount of evidence that Anubis is bringing up, and makes him self-reflect on his own darkness.
- Within his own mind, Yugi goes searching for his other self and finds him within the maze, staring at a giant floating Pyramid of Light destroying a similarly big Millennium Puzzle. That image seems to be a representation of how is he feeling at the moment, or how his own actions have shaken him to his core. But Yugi conforts him and takes over the duel for him, saying that he has far many acts of good and courage for him and for others. He has changed for the better and he is a remarkable person in whom he trusts.
- Yugi plays a card that allows him to evolve a broken or illegal card from outside his deck, and he looks towards his grandpa. Sugoroku gets his treasured card, the one that he carries with him everywhere, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon that Kaiba ripped in half, and he offers it to his grandson. Together, Yugi and the other Yugi call forwards "Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon" and use him to defeat Anubis.
- After his defeat, Anubis accepts that the Pharaoh has defeated his own darkness. He is rejoiced, as his duty is over and he can finally rest. He wishes him the best in the large battle still to come, as this was his final test before facing his memories, and he says that if his choice is to forgive Shadi, Anubis will accept it. With that, Anubis fades away and in its place Fizdis reappers on her knees, petting the dog who also returned to his normal self. The small blue pyramid in the dog's collar breaks in half.
- Fizdis stands up and looks at her deck, seeing the cards that Anubis used including the "Pyramid of Light" card. She saves her deck in his pocket and approaches Shadi, asking for his forgiveness for attacking him like that. Shadi also apologizes for what he has done. He tells them about his past, and on how after he died he started to lose his humanity little by little. Before that he always was caring for the most unfortunate ones, thinking back to "the childrens of Purana", hoping they were safe wherever they were.
- Shadi admits that Fizdis and Sugoroku are the true owners of the Scales and Ankh respectively. He suspected for a while that he wasn't going to be the one to give the objects to the Pharaoh, as they had gradually been becoming weaker and weaker for him, most likely a result of him being death and unable to draw all of their potential. But now they are at full strength once again in the hands of their rightful owners, which makes sense as the Pharaoh would need all the seven items in all of their might soon.
- Fizdis says that she doesn't really want the Scales. She doesn't know much about this quest they are doing, other than what Ishizu and Sugoroku told her. She only wanted to heal her uncle. The Scales and the Ankh shine in that moment, and they all have a shared vision of Yoshimori struggling to move while strapped to a bed and then suddenly stopping himself, opening his eyes with lucidity once more. Sugoroku understands what has happened and smiles to her, as a tear drops through her cheek.
- She then gives Yugi her Millennium Scales and Sugoroku gives him the Millennium Ankh. With this, the Pharaoh has all the elements to finally uncover the secrets of his past.

## Episode 124 - The Opened Door of Memories

![](/img/storyimg/ep0124.jpg)

---

- They all leave the ruins and set to depart to the place where the tablets of lost memories are. Shadi decides to go with them. As they are getting ready to get in the cars, Fizdis is wondering what to do with the dog. Honda is playing with the dog and tells her that he also has a dog back at home named Blankey, and that she should keep him. Shadi tells her that is likely the dog was a stray dog because no one lives nearby. The dog is behaving like a normal dog and doesn't want to get far from her, so she decides to adopt him. Honda asks what is she going to name it and she decides to simply go for "Anubis", smiling.
- They all set in motion and arrive in just a couple of hours to the designated place. It's a small structure with a set of stairs that go into the ground. They go down there and find the two giant stone tablets. Jonouchi and Honda are surprised as this is the first time they see them and comment that its true that Yugi is depicted in one of the tablets.
- Yugi places his bag with the millennium items in the floor and holds his three God Cards against the tablet. The Millennium Symbol appears in the forehead of Yugi, but also on the foreheads of Marik and Ishizu who are there. And also Fizdis and Sugoroku. And far away from there, in what seems to be a southern European country, also on Pegasus' forehead, who acknowledges that the day has finally arrived. Surprisingly it appears in the forehead of Bakura too, who is hiding nearby where Yugi and his friends are, and smiles with evil intent. 
- The spirit of the Pharaoh is detached from Yugi and sent into the tablet itself, into another world. At the same time, Bakura's spirit is shown leaving his host behind, who immediately collapses. The evil spirit merges with the portion of himself that he had left hidden in the Millennium Puzzle so he is complete once again. 
- In Japan, Kaiba has a vision of all of this and slams his desk. He steps up, grabs his coat and decides to get to the bottom of this once and for all, departing to Cairo in his jet. 
- The Pharaoh appears in Ancient Egypt. He notices an inverted pyramid sticking out of the sky. He is the only one who can see it however, and wonders if it represents that this world is made of his own memories and is not the actual past. 
- He is confused when a man resembling Sugoroku (who reminds him that he is his vizier Siamun Muran, and that he should feel very tired as they've known for so long), guides him to the court room of the palace. In there, he meets the six High Priests of his royal court. Each one of them has been entrusted with a Millennium Item, and they are: Akhenaden (Eye), Seto (Rod), Isis (Necklace/Tauk), Shada (Ankh), Mahado (Ring), Karim (Scales). Some of them also bear a strong resemblance to Yugi's present-time friends, like Isis with Ishizu, Shada with Shadi and Seto with Kaiba. 
- There is a celebration going on in his honor, but an intruder managed to sneak inside the chamber, and makes an attempt on the Pharaoh's life. He is stopped and caught, initiating a "**Millennium Trial**" carried on by Seto and supported by the magic of the other Millennium Items. The Pharaoh is surprised as this is similar to a duel, and they even have what seem to be ancient Duel Disk on their arms. For the trial, Shada uses the Millennium Key to read the assassin's mind, and finds out there is an evil creature lurking inside his heart. Akhenaden uses the Millennium Eye, to reveal & extract the monster dwelling inside the heart of assassin. Finally, after the duel is won, Seto uses the Millennium Rod to seal the monster inside a Stone Tablet. Now that the darkness in his soul has been banished, the assassin is set free.
- Meanwhile, Bakura is transported to his real ancient identity: Thief King Bakura. He is in chains and being carried outside the city, when a group of his follower free him and led back to his camp. 
- In the present, Yugi laments that he cannot sense the Pharaoh anymore. He says that he is gone, and starts crying, as his friends are in disbelief.

## Episode 125 - Thief King Bakura Appears!

![](/img/storyimg/ep0125.jpg)

---

- In the present times, Yugi and his friends are shocked about having lost contact with the Pharaoh. But Shadi intercedes and tells them what he knows: to recover his memories, the Pharaoh must relive his ancient past once again, within a fictional world made of his own memories. Yugi and his friends want to help him, and Shadi says that together, all four of them could help the Pharaoh as they have been touched by all the Millennium Items at one point or another.
- Puzzle: They all were connected through the Puzzle in the first place. Eye: They all were frozen in time by the Eye during Yugi's first duel with Pegasus, and later Honda and Anzu also got affected by its magic when they were sneaking upon Pegasus room. Ring: They all got their souls detached and transfered to cards during Bakura's first duel with the Pharaoh. Ankh: Anzu had her mind room 'redecorated' by Shadi, who also entered Yugi's mind. Rod: Jonouchi and Anzu were mind-controlled by it. Tauk: Yugi and Anzu saw a vision through it. The only one missing is the Scales.
- Shadi looks at Fizdis, who sheepishly takes the Millennium Scales from the bag and extends towards them, one by one. As she enters the heart of each one, a series of flashbacks are seen on their relationships with the Pharaoh. After finishing, she says that the only thing she could feel from them was beautiful bonds and trust towards the other Yugi.
- Shadi then says that he will help them reach the world of memories, and the four of them hold hands together with him in a circle. Marik grabs the Rod, Ishizu the Necklace and Sugoroku the Ankh. The four previous Millennium Item wielders extend the items towards them. At the same time, Marik places the Rod on Jonouchi's back, Ishizu her Necklace on Anzu's back, Fizdis her Scales on Honda's back, and finally Sugoroku his Ankh on Yugi's back. The Millennium Ankh shine with a higher intensity than the others and everything becomes white.
- Meanwhile in the world of memories, the Thief King has ransacked a tomb and has taken a sarcophagus with him all the way to the royal palace. In there, he **challenges** the Pharaoh and the High Priests with his terrifying *Ka*: Diabound. The Other Yugi is surprised to see him there, but Bakura mocks him, saying that this is the ultimate shadow game. The sarcophagus he carried has the remains of the late Pharaoh Akhenamkanen, which was the Other Yugi's father.
- The High Priests try to stop him but are unable to do so, as Diabound is too strong. As they fight, Bakura reveals that the previous Pharaoh was a tyrant who ravaged Bakura's village of Kul Elna to create the seven Millennium Items. Akhenaden accuses Bakura of lying, saying that Akhenamkanen put an end to the great war bringing peace and prosperity and created the items to ensure that harmony would reign forever in Egypt. Bakura replies that the items were made by a ritual of darkness, and they hold the pathway to the 'dark world'.
- Suddenly the Pharaoh enters the battle and summons his God: Obelisk, which ties in force with an emergency attack from Diabound, otherwise Bakura would have been destroyed by it. That attack from Diabound was actually taken from Kaiba by Bakura recently, and is the Prominent Burst Stream from Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Bakura is glad of having taken that power from Kaiba, otherwise he would have lost to Obelisk right then and there, as he didn't expected for the Pharaoh to know how to call the gods to their battle. 
- At this point, Bakura climbs back on his horse and escapes the palace.

## Episode 126 - The High Priests of the Pharaoh

![](/img/storyimg/ep0126.jpg)

---

- Back in the present, the group is wandering within the Millennium Puzzle together with Shadi. They are searching for the door to the world of memories.
- In the Palace, the Pharaoh learns more about the Six Priests, as they start the chase of Bakura. Seto and Akhenaden deploy the royal army to scout for him. Seto suggests finding criminals and capture them to extract their Ka to get a powerful enough weapon that could help them against Bakura. Akhenaden argues that creating a Ka from hatred is a terrifying thing to do. Seto goes on saying this: if they can reduce the number of criminals with this, they'll be essentially killing two birds with one stone.
- Meanwhile Isis is attempting to use her Millennium Necklace to foresee the future, but in vain. Ever since Bakura arrived, her vision of the future has been clouded by a creeping shadow.
- The Pharaoh and Mahado are walking outside the palace when they are intercepted by Mana (who strikes a very close resemblance to "Dark Magician Girl"), a childhood friend of them both and a student of Mahado. Mana distractedly calls the Pharaoh 'Prince', which causes Mahado to scold her as their friend is the Pharaoh now. The Pharaoh doesn't mind and is amused when Mahado makes a slip and also calls him 'prince', something which makes Mana giggle. He is thankful to know that here in his own past he had friends. 
- The Pharaoh tries to ask Mana what his own name is, but she goes on muttering without being able to tell him his name.
- Meanwhile from a distance, the Thief King is thinking about how to get a hold of the Millennium Items. Doing it at once is impossible so he decides to go one by one.
- Back in the court, Mahahdo tells the Pharaoh that his team of sorcerers is getting ready to place a new seal around the tomb of Akhenamkanen as they speak. He sets off to the tomb with his servants. Isis tries to use her Millennium Necklace to foresee the future, and this time it shows glimpses of a tragedy awaiting Mahado. Mana wants to accompany her master, but Siamun Muran prevents her from leaving, saying it is too dangerous and she is only a student. Thinking to himself, he also reveals that Mahado's strength as a wizard was so great he had to seal part of it to prevent harm from being done. If he were to unleash his true power, he would be more powerful than any of the Priests in the Pharaoh's court and the most powerful magician in the whole world.
- As he is leaving, Mahado is confronted by Isis who tells him of her doubts concerning his future. Mahado tells her not to worry and that he would prefer not to know what she saw. Instead of going to the Valley of Kings (where Akhenamkanen tomb is), Mahado goes to the Magicians' Training Ground and calls upon the power of his Millennium Ring to unleash the ancient power he once concealed there.
- Thief King Bakura enters the sanctuary and is separated from his faithful servants who are confronted by Mahado's magicians. He contronts Mahado alone, who was waiting for him for a **duel**. Diabound has evolved since his last battle and is more dangerous that before. Mahado uses his recovered power to gain the upper hand, to Bakura's surprise.
- Meanwhile, the Pharaoh has traveled to Mahado's Tablet Shrine and found Mana, who also sensed something was happening to her master. They notice the Sealing Tablet of "Illusion Magician" is slowly beginning to crumble, meaning Mahado's monster is losing its energy. They depart towards the Magicians' Training Grounds.
- Back in the present, Yugi and his friend are still stuck inside the Millennium Puzzle but they finally stumble on a door that could have some meaning. As they open it, they see the shape of their friend Bakura but it turns out it's actually his evil self, that then transforms into a monster and knocks them out of the room, and disappears. Shadi warns them that it meant to represent the identity of the Pharaoh's true enemy.
- The battle between Mahado and Bakura continues, and several real traps are activated within the place. Feeling close to defeat, Mahado transfers his spirit into his monster, forfeiting his own life. As he does this, the Pharaoh and the Six Priests feel that he is dead. The Millennium Ring is finally in Bakura's possession, but Mahado has now created the ultimate magician: "Dark Magician", and fused with it. Dark Magician uses his power to destroy Diabound and collapse the stone bridge in where they were fighting on. After the battle, Dark Magician is sealed in the Sealing Tablet, just when the Pharaoh and the rest arrive to that place.

## Episode 127 - Blue-Eyed Kisara

![](/img/storyimg/ep0127.jpg)

---

- Mana is distraught at the loss of her master. Isis explains that he has become the "Dark Magician" and will eventually return with greater powers then ever before. Seto and Shada head out into the city to search for people with strong monsters within them, as they think that Bakura will return.
- Back at the palace, the high priests discuss the recent events. Despite seemingly having been buried in the collapse of the Magicians' Training Grounds, there is no certainty on Thief King Bakura's fate. A scene of Thief King Bakura emerging from river rapids is shown: He is still alive, and even admits to himself that it has been too long since he's been this afraid.
- Meanwhile, Yugi and his friends have found the door which opens to the world of memories: they are on top of the giant inverted pyramid in the sky and can see the city hundreds of meters below them. Shadi bids them farewell and good luck. They jump from that height and land harmlessly to the ground. Despite dressed in modern day clothes, no one seems to notice them. Then, a girl walks right through Jonouchi as if he were immaterial. Apparently no one can see them and they cannot interact with things or people in there.
- Seto and Shada search for "suspects" and **quickly judge them** in a "Millennium Trial" even if they haven't commited a crime yet. People protest and claim of injustice, but the two High Priests persist on their task.
- Yugi and his friends must find a way to go and meet the Pharaoh. Jonouchi and Honda however complain of hunger. They stumble across a large man dressed in red clothes eating apples in the market, yet no one seems to be noticing him. What's most surprising is that he can see them. They start chasing him around but eventually he disappears and they stumble across a white-haired girl with large blue eyes that is being stoned by an angry mob who believe she is a witch. Jonouchi and Honda try to protect her but they cannot as they are immaterial.
- Attracted by all the confusion, Shada arrives. His Millennium Ankh immediately senses the immense power within the girl and he **starts a trial**. Her eyes shine with a powerful blue light and Shada is completely overpowered by her, as the White Dragon appears and defeats him in an instant. Shada falls to his knees, and the girl falls unconscious.
- Seto arrives, surprised to see Shada fall in combat. The group is also really surprised seeing his resemblance to Kaiba. Seto orders his guards to take the girl back to the palace. Yugi and his friends follow behind but are stopped by the palace doors, which for some reason are solid to them. They are then greeted by the large man in red clothes they met before at the market: His name is Bobasa and he is a spirit like them. For some reason however, he is capable of touching objects and he gives Jonouchi and Honda a big load of fruits to eat. Anzu begins to asks questions, but he's unable to answer any of them.
- Seto announces to Akhenaden that their search for Ka in the city was better than expected. Akhenaden gaps upon realizing that Seto has imprisoned them, and implores that he release them but Seto refuses. He's doing everything for both the sake of the Pharaoh and the land of Egypt. He then excuses himself and departs.
- Seto visits the unconscious Kisara. Touching her face, he feels his heart begin to beat faster. Has he met the girl somewhere before? In a flashback, it is revealed that she is the same girl Seto once saved from the clutches of slave traders. As a result, his village was raided by those criminals and he was forced to watch as his home burnt to the ground. A White Dragon (identical to the Blue-Eyes White Dragon) appeared at that moment and destroyed the criminals.
- Akhenaden, who was left alone by Seto, turns around only to find Thief King Bakura smiling at him.

## Episode 128 - The Secret of the Millennium Items

![](/img/storyimg/ep0128.jpg)

---

- As the night falls, Thief King Bakura uses his newly acquired Millennium Ring to become invisible, enter the palace undetected and find Akhenaden. He challenges him to a **duel**. Akhenaden is not weak, but he is still overpowered by Bakura and defeated. As he approaches him, Bakura reveals that him and Akhenaden still have a score to settle.
- Siamun Muran, the Pharaoh and the other high priests sense danger and they all go to Akhenaden Wedge Temple, where they find Akhenaden in the ground. He is still alive, and his Millennium Eye is still in place but there are traces of blood all around it. Bakura escapes using his Diabound to overpower the guards, but the Pharaoh follows him, summoning the second god: Osiris.
- Meanwhile, a wounded Akhenaden lies on his bed. We are taken to a vision of his past during the time where the previous Pharaoh ruled. The country was being invaded and in danger of total annihilation, as their defenses were collapsing one after another. A younger Akhenaden would then report that they had managed to translate one of the "Millennium Spellbook" spells, one that would allow them to forge seven treasures possessing mysterious powers that could be used to triumph over the invaders and bring peace to Egypt. The Pharaoh Akhenamkanen agrees with them to proceed in the construction of those seven treasures, trusting in his brother Akhenaden, knowing they have no other choice.
- Before he departs, Akhenaden is shown talking to a young woman with a small child, saying to her that he is sorry but in order to save their kingdom he must seal their connection. He would throw away his title of younger brother of the Pharaoh after that night. He also says that she, his wife, and his son, Seto, would need to go live in another city, away from him. He wishes them the best.
- As they arrive at the village of Kul Elna, Akhenaden casts a spell on his own soldiers to obey and do not reveal the truth on what they are about to witness. According to the sacred book of spells, human sacrifices are needed in order to create the seven Millennium Items, something which Pharaoh Akhenamkanen would never approve. The soldiers then capture Kul Elna's inhabitants and take them inside a forge where they are then melted alive in an enormous cauldron. Only a hidden young boy with white hair (Bakura) survives and observes the atrocious act. The entire village population is wiped out in a single night.
- Then, Akhenaden priests break the stone around the forge, taking the now completed Millennium Items. The ritual has worked. However something else emerges from deep inside the earth: it is the Tablet of the Realm of the Dead, and it has seven engravings on it where the items can be placed. An evil creature is released from there, demanding Akhenaden to place the items in the tablet. Akhenaden seizes the Millennium Eye and inserts it into his own eye socked, repelling the apparition. The remaining priests take the items and flee the place. Since the Tablet has nothing on it, the evil apparition is forced back into its own dimension.
- Akhenaden managed to return to the city with all seven items, as his other companions collapsed from fatigue and died in the desert. With the Millennium Items, the first High Priests alonside the Pharaoh managed to stop the invaders and defeat them. Years later, a now grown-up Seto has become the new holder of the Millennium Rod. Despite not being highborn, he rose to excellence and overcame all odds to find his way into the royal court where, unbeknowst to him, he will serve alongside his father Akhenaden to protect the Pharaoh.
- Akhenaden's memories then end and he reflects upon them. Wounded lying on his bed, his heart corrupted by Thief King Bakura, he vows to give his son the throne and make him become Pharaoh instead of Yugi's alter-ego.

## Episode 129 - A Reversal of Fortune

![](/img/storyimg/ep0129.jpg)

---

- The Pharaoh is with Osiris in pursuit of Bakura in their second **encounter**. The two of them are in horses and use their monsters to blast through the palace doors and leave. Yugi and his friends, who were resting near the palace door see the Pharaoh as Yugi's other self and run after them. Bakura starts using Diabound to attack the city instead of the Pharaoh. In turn, he uses Osiris to protect the villagers, placing itself between them and Diabound's attacks. Then, Osiris seizes Diabound by the tail and carries it to the skies, in order to continue the battle away from the city. 
- At this point, Bakura gives the Pharaoh an ultimatum: surrender his Millennium Puzzle or see himself and his city perish. The Pharaoh takes the Puzzle off his neck, making it seem he agrees to Bakura's terms. However he unleashes Osiris onto Bakura, and Bakura does the same with Diabound onto the Pharaoh. It seems like a stalemate. Then, Seto's Ka "Duos" intervenes in the nick of time: he and Karim have arrived to bring the Pharaoh assistance. Bakura decides it's time for a strategic retreat.
- With a large part of the city in flames, Seto gives orders to his men to evacuate all civilians to the Royal palace's courtyard. Eventually, the Pharaoh reaches Bakura and the two resume fighting. Back at the Royal palace, inside the Pharaoh's Wedge Temple, an evil-possessed Akhenaden throws a scimitar into Osiris' Stone Tablet. The Egyptian God is paralyzed for a moment, and cannot avoid destruction by Diabound's Spiral Surge attack. Akhenaden's actions have angered the Gods, and he is struck by a bolt of energy. He collapses to the floor unconscious.
- Seto arrives and orders Duos to join the fight. At this point, the Pharaoh falls from his horse and faints: losing Osiris sapped him of a large part of his life energy, and he is too weak to continue the fight. However, he soon opens his eyes and sees... Yugi and his friends! He can see them, they are here in his world of memories helping him. Because of the special bond which connects them, by holding hands with him Yugi is able to restore the Pharaoh's life energy.
- The Pharaoh jumps back on his horse and Summons "The Winged Dragon of Ra". Ra's energy radiates a light so bright that it illuminates the entire kingdom, as it were daylight. Without the obscurity to conceal himself, Bakura's "Diabound" is revealed. However, by defeating Osiris "Diabound" was able to absorb part of its power: it thus uses Osiris' Thunder Force for a direct attack on Ra, but Duos intercepts the attack. The Pharaoh turns Ra into Egyptian God Phoenix which then attacks Diabound and obliterates Bakura's monster.
- However, Bakura has one more trick up his sleeve: he reverses the "Sands of Time" so that he may alter the past (mechanically unexplained at this point). The recent events rewind, including the **duel**, all the way back to the point where Bakura's "Diabound" destroyed the Pharaoh's Osiris. This time however Yugi and his friends are stopped by another Bakura, one dressed with his modern clothes, who materialises a duel disk on his hand. Jonouchi steps forward and also materialises one. 
- The two of them clash in a brief **duel**, but that's everything that Thief King Bakura needed. Their arrival to assist the Pharaoh is delayed, and Bakura can order his Diabound to attack once again, causing the Pharaoh to fall down a precipice but not before Bakura seizes his Millennium Puzzle. The world is then consumed by darkness. As the Pharaoh was knocked unconscious, his memories ceased and the world stopped. By the time the darkness lifted, the duel had stopped and both Bakuras had left.

## Episode 130 - In Search of a King

![](/img/storyimg/ep0130.jpg)

---

- During the battle, the Pharaoh has fallen through a cliff. Yugi and his friends have no choice but to retreat, helped by Bobasa. It seems that with the Pharaoh gone, Bakura's victory is only a formality now. However, is he really dead? If this is the world of memories of the Pharaoh, he must be still alive.
- Meanwhile, Seto is ordering his men to redouble their efforts at finding the Pharaoh. Isis is searching with ther Necklace but there is little she can see. Meanwhile Seto and Shada find out that Akhenaden has taken Kisara to a subterranean battleground. In there, Akhenaden seem to have taken Seto's plan to raise an army of Ka to the next level: he has the prisoners fighting each other for survival to increase the powers of their Ka. 
- When they arrive, Akhenaden welcomes them and tells them that Kisara has just **defeated** two men before he arrived with just her power, but hasn't summoned her true Ka. And she is now **facing** Gebelk, one of Akhenaden personal servants. Seto confronts Akhenaden, and he replies that since the Pharaoh is gone, the time has come for a new Pharaoh to rise to the throne and save Egypt, someone like Seto. Kisara is pushed back as she seem too terrorized to fight back. Seto summons Duos and steps in, cutting the chains that suspend the arena platform. He grabs her hand as she hangs onto a chain. Gebelk looks at Akhenaden and he nods, so Gebelk attacks Seto. At this point, Kisara's eyes start glowing and she emanates a very bright aura. Akhenaden is rejoiced as The White Dragon shows up, and he says to Seto that this power is above that of Bakura's Diabound, and even could be above the three gods controlled by the Pharaoh. He orders Seto to take the Ka from the woman, but Seto refuses as that would kill her. The White Dragon destroys Gebelk and his monster with a powerful beam of light.
- Meanwhile back at Kul Elna, Thief King Bakura is placing the Millennium Puzzle and Ring in the Millennium Tablet. He mutters to himself that his plan is working great and that soon the door of the realm of the dead shall open, bringing back his real form, that of the Great Wicked God Zorc. But he still needs the eight key to remove the seal on Zorc within the real world, as that's what sealed Zorc 3000 years ago. He has searched for it in vain so far, as the Pharaoh erased all evidence of that key. Suddenly Bakura has a flashback of the Tablet of Lost Memories and finally realizes that there was something intentionally erased from that tablet, not by erosion or accidental destruction: the Pharaoh's real name. He smiles. That's it, his name is the eight key.
- Meanwhile, Yugi and his friends are still busy looking for the Pharaoh. They arrive at the Nile river, and come across Mana practicing her magic. It seems as if Mana can actually see them too. She recognizes Yugi as the Pharaoh, but is puzzled as to why he shrunk so much and is dressed in strange clothes. Meanwhile, Bobasa found the Pharaoh's blue cape floating in the Nile. That means he must be nearby, but at this point, the rider servants of Thief King Bakura arrive and charge towards them. Mana uses some magic to cast a giant wave that sweeps them away. They all then resume their search for the Pharaoh. Meanwhile Shada's men have picked up the trail of Bakura, while Isis and Karim are still looking for the Pharaoh.
- The Pharaoh wakes up inside a cave, and thinks about what Bakura said before about his father Akhenamkanen. Could he really be as evil as Bakura described him? The Pharaoh has a vision of his childhood years, his birth, growing up and being guided by him. The flashback then extends to a shrine in tribute of all past Egyptian Pharaohs. Akhenamkanen had gone there with him to take responsibility for his own sins, of the creation of the seven Millennium Items. He begged at that place not for forgiveness for himself, but to spare his son. He says that he will take all the consequences upon his own shoulders. The Other Yugi knows that his father really loved him.
- Then, a myterious figure with a golden mask appears to the Pharaoh. His name is Hasan he says, and he has come to warn the Pharaoh that the Great Evil Zorc will soon be resurrected and only he can defeat it. He also adds that "the previous Pharaoh Akhenamkanen has been watching over you". When the Pharaoh tries to question him about knowing his father, the illusions fades and the Pharaoh finds himself in a cave. As he steps out of it, he stumbles upon Yugi and the rest.
- As they reunite, they talk about everything while Bobasa plays in the river with Mana. The Pharaoh tells Yugi about retrieving part of his memories, his father and the sinister history associated with the seven Millennium Items.
- Meanwhile, Seto is standing by Kisara's bedside as she has fallen unconscious once again. He reflects on how much Akhenaden has changed recently, as he was the man who taught him compassion and reason back when he first entered the royal court. He can hardly recognize him now. Suddenly a guard walks and announce that the Pharaoh has been found. The morale of the troops rise and all the priests rush towards him.
- Shada and his men are the first to arrive to where the Pharaoh is. It seems that only the Other Yugi and Mana are able to see Yugi and the rest. Shada tells the Pharaoh his men have found the hiding place of Thief King Bakura: the deserted village of Kul Elna. They immediately depart, taking Mana with them and sending word to Seto and the rest to meet them there. Yugi and his friends want to help but they are left behind for now, as the Pharaoh says he is happy to see tham but that they should return to their own world safely now.

## Episode 131 - The Village of Kul-Elna

![](/img/storyimg/ep0131.jpg)

---

- In the present, it's been a long time since Yugi and the rest went into the world of memories. Their bodies has been left behind and taken care of by Ishizu and the others. They have found Bakura unconscious in the stairs nearby, and they also have placed him near the tablet. Shadi has not come back either, so the only thing they can do is take care of their bodies and await for the return of their souls.
- Suddenly there is a powerful noise coming from outside. The group go out and see that a jet with the shape of a Blue-Eyes White Dragon has landed in the vicinity. Seto Kaiba climbs down and goes to meet them. Marik asks how has he found them there and Kaiba simply replies that using his satellites and infraestructure he can find anyone anywhere in the world. Ishizu says that she hoped that he'd come to Egypt, but asks why he's so suddenly interested on the past. 
- He says that he keeps having visions after his recent battle with Bakura, and is there to put an end to everything related to that. Ishizu nods and guides him towards the interior of that place. He is surprised to see Yugi and the rest knocked out in front of the tablets, specially Bakura. Ishizu explains to him what happened, but also points out to the Millennium Items that each one of them is carrying around. Six of the seven Millennium Items are shining, meaning that they are active, using their powers to send the souls to the world of memories. The souls of Yugi, Anzu, Honda and Jonouchi were sent by them after the souls of the Pharaoh and the evil spirit within Bakura departed first. Sadly, they cannot help Kaiba go because they are already using their powers to send the others to that place.
- Suddenly a faint helicopter noise is heard and, shortly after that, a man climbs down the stairs to where they are: it's Pegasus, who cheerfully says that he was already in Egypt looking to find them when "he saw Kaiba-boy's plane" and decided to tail him. Kaiba scorns at him, but Pegasus steps forward and grabs his Millennium Eye, saying that he never thought he'd see that object again. After that, Ishizu nodes and tells him what to do to help. He places the item in Kaiba's back and the Eye starts to shine like the others.
- Back in the world of memories, The Pharaoh and the rest arrive at Kul Elna. The spirits of the dead manifest their presence and start **attacking** them. Mana casts a spell that finally materializes her own Ka, the Dark Magician Girl, and wipes out a good portion of the enemy. Bakura **confronts** the Pharaoh in the tomb, but the spirit of Dark Magician (Mahado) appears to protect him. An intense duel begins once again between the two. As they fight, Bakura reveals the truth about what happened at Kul Elna and the role of his father in all of this. The Pharaoh asks Mahado if the story is true and he confirms it, but the king was unaware of the actions taken in the village of Kul Elna, but it was his responsibility so he went to seek punishment by the gods but absolution for his son. 
- Thanks to his previous battles, Diabound has evolved and is strong. But Mahado is a powerful mage and manages to stop him. During the battle the Millennium Tablet is in danger and Bakura orders Diabound to protect it, but the Pharaoh takes the opportunity to take the advantage. At this point, Bakura calls upon the dead spirits of Kul Elna to replenish his life force and augment his power. Diabound becomes even stronger. Mahado is about to be destroyed but Dark Magician Girl (controlled by Mana) arrives in the nick of time to save him.
- Seto, Siamun Muran, Karim and Isis have finally arrived to Kul Elna to provide assistance. As Shada continues to hold back the spirits, Seto and the others go to the underground shrine to help the Pharaoh. In there, Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl combine forces to attack Diabound but without success: the spirits are not only protecting him but also increasing its strength. The priests join the fight.
- Meanwhile, Akhenaden arrives at Kul Elna too and the spirits start attacking him with special fury. He is saved by Shada, who then goes to investigate one of the houses only to find out the stone tablet of Bakura's Diabound, understanding that as long as the hatred of the village is not erased Diabound shall not vanish. He realizes that attacking the tablet would also destroy the creature. When he is about to destroy it, Akhenaden hits him with a big rock from behind, knocking him out and taking the Millennium Ankh for himself.
- As the battle continues, both sides fight to the death. One of Bakura's attacks fatally wounds Karim, allowing the spirits of Kul Elna to seize his Millennium Scale. Trying to protect his Priests' from the anger of the spirits, the Pharaoh walks forward asking them to judge him instead. The spirits enter his body and attempt to absorb his soul. However, the spirit of Akhenamkanen himself appears in front to protect him, absorbing all the hate unto himself and leading them to the realm of the dead where they belong.
- Now that Diabound is weakened without the evil spirits, the Pharaoh attacks him with Dark Magician and destroys it, shattering its stone tablet and finally defeating Bakura.

## Episode 132 - High Priest of Darkness

![](/img/storyimg/ep0132.jpg)

---

- Yugi and his friends are trying to do something useful for their friend. They remember the words of Shadi about the Pharaoh's true foe and how he defeated it using its own name. They decide to go search for the Pharaoh's real name back at the palace. As they arrive there, they can somehow pass through the door that they couldn't before. They enter the palace and separate to search more efficiently because the place is too big. 
- Sadly, they realize that conducting a search while "immaterial" is no easy task. Anzu has found the palace library, but is having trouble making "contact" with the papyrus parchments. Yugi has found giant hieroglyphs but has no idea what do they mean. Jonouchi sees a servant identical to Fizdis and tries to ask for help but she cannot see him and pass right through him. Bobasa, unlike the others, has no problems and is stuffing himself full of food in the royal kitchens.
- Back at Kul Elna, Thief King Bakura collapses down the stairs after Diabound is destroyed. He drags himself to the tablet and inserts the Millennium Items he's accumulated so far (Puzzle, Scale and Ring), but the Pharaoh tells him its useless. Without the rest of the items he won't be able to free Zorc. He tells him to surrender,, as he has been defeated. However, Akhenaden enters the room holding the Millennium Key and asking the Pharaoh if he is sure about that.
- At this point, Bakura starts glowing in a sinister purple light, which then separates from his body. He seems confused and does not understand where he is. Thief King Bakura's body start to disintegrate and turn into sand as he screams in pain, while a voice in the air (the voice of Bakura) says that he as a pawn is no longer useful. Shada appears at the doorstep to warn the others but is too late. 
- Akhenaden treachery is revealed, and casts an immobility spell on the group, freezing them and taking their Millennium Items. He inserts them all into the tablet, extracting his own eye from the flesh itself. The Pharaoh is asking himself how can this be, as Thief King Bakura has been defeated therefore the Shadow Game should be over. But then it clicks and he realizes: "game", everything is happening inside of a game!
- At that point the other Yugi "wakes up" and sees the evil Bakura sitting across him in front of a large table. On that table there is a playing field that represents the land of Egypt from the past, as this has been an epic tile duel between the two of them with a series of subduels happening as the story progressed. The evil Bakura explains everything to him, how they are the "game masters" of that "dark RPG", how they have characters and allies and special cards that activate to change the events of the story, like rewinding time itself to prevent his death at the hands of Ra. As the seven items have been placed on the stone tablet, the rules change and now the only way for Bakura to be defeated is to take down Zorc, who is about to revive.
- Bakura reveals that Yugi's pawns (his friends) are frozen in time thanks to Bakura's spell. Not only the High Priests are affected by this (except Akhenaden), but Yugi, Anzu and Jonouchi are also frozen in time while they were searching for the name. Honda however is able to move, and it is now revealed to the viewer that Bakura had possessed Honda back when the two of them exchanged blows before after Bakura reversed time for the first time, and he has been keeping tabs on them through him. This was the materialized form of Bakura that had a brief interrupted duel with Jonouchi before reversing time, and is now controlling Honda's body completely. What Honda is unable to figure out however is why Bobasa is unaffected by the time-freezing spell.
- Back at Kul Elna, Akhenaden has just summoned the Great Wicked God Zorc, who is still forming as a dark cloud but speaks to him and gives him a wish as a gift for his loyalty. Akhenaden just ask for his son, Seto, to become the new monarch. That comes as a huge revelation to everyone present, including Seto himself. Zorc agrees and transforms Akhenaden into a monster figure giving him new powers. 
- The Evil Bakura reveals that in the game he has found a way to bring back Zorc without the eight Key (the Pharaoh's real name): by using his third and final hourglass, when the last grain of sand falls Zorc shall be reborn. Meanwhile at the royal palace Honda is walking through a room that has all the past Pharaohs, but even there the current Pharaoh's tablet name is completely blank. 
- The Dark Priest Akhenaden reveals the story of his past to Seto and the others (who are still frozen in time). He tells them on how in reality he was the twin brother of King Akhenamkanen. Therefore, Seto is the cousin of the current Pharaoh and has the necessary bloodline to inherit the throne. He then casts a spell to kill the Pharaoh, **however** a mysterious entity shining with light appears to deflect the attack: it is Hasan, the protector of the Millennium Items. 
- The Other Yugi, in the Dark RPG has revealed to Bakura how he played the card of Hasan into the game, smiling and saying that he also has master cards like bakura's hourglasses.
- Hasan deflects the attack, which ends up destroying Bakura's time-freezing hourglass in the main game, freeing Yugi's "pieces". Akhenaden tries to convince his son Seto to join him as Zorc's servant. He reveals everything about the creation of the Millennium Items, his role in it, his secret jealousy towards his brother and everything he did to help Seto climb up the ranks once he saw him again as an adult. It was fate, he said, and he knew that his son must be the true Pharaoh. He pleads for him to remember the power of the White Dragon that would guide his hand and make him the true Pharaoh. 
- Seto is shocked by everything that has been revealed so far. The Pharaoh tries to talk to him, trusting in his friend, but Akhenaden stops him with a magic attack that encircles him and everyone else except Seto and Akhenaden. Before they can do anything, they are all teleported away back at the capital, leaving only Seto behind. Sensing that Seto is slowly giving in to temptation, Kisara wakes up at the Royal Palace and sets off to find him. 
- Back at the Royal Palace, Bobasa is crying because there's not more food left in the kitchens. He has eaten everything. The others (who were confused at why they were frozen in time for a while) want to leave him, but Yugi decides they will help him get more food. They find some grapes for him. He thanks them and... starts floating. He has turned into a means of aerial transportation. Everybody jumps on his back and he start floating towards the desert. Honda (Bakura actually) thinks to himself that that obese guy is definetely part of the game's scenario, probably a hidden switch devised to find the eight Key.
- The group arrive at the Valley of the Kings: it's the place where Sugoroku Muto found the Millennium Puzzle originally. Bobasa thanks them for the food and for a moment his face becomes the face of Shadi, to everyone's surprise. He says goodbye to them, and vanishes into thin air. Back at the main game, the card of Bobasa is finally revealed. The Other Yugi looks at the entrance of the giant Millennium Puzzle in the sky and sees Shadi there, who bows to him one last time before disappearing into the wind for the last time.

## Episode 133 - White Dragon

![](/img/storyimg/ep0133.jpg)

---

- Back at the Egyptian capital, Seto Kaiba has just woken up. He thinks this may just be a dream or a hallucination, but he soon realizes it is not when 2 children pass right through him as if he were immaterial. He then comes across Kisara, who is still searching for Priest Seto. Kaiba remembers her as the girl he saw in his vision from when Ishizu brought the Tablet of Lost Memories to Japan. He is surprised to find that Kisara can see him.
- The Pharaoh and the rest has been transported to the city and they are healing their wounds after the battle. Zorc's resurrection is near, and they have to get ready. The Pharaoh gets on his horse and accompanied by Hasan and the ones that are in better shape they are set to depart once again to Kul Elna, praying to make it in time. Isis, Shada and Karim have to stay behind because of their injuries.
- Meanwhile, back at Kul Elna, Seto is surrounded by a cloud of dark energy. Akhenaden steps outside of it and sees that the entire village is being destroyed by the dark magic comic out from the tablet of the Millennium Items. Soon there will be no more Kul Elna. He teleports the two of them to his own temple in the Royal Palace, as he intends to finish what he started. He summon all the creatures he can, creating chaos all around. He leaves Seto behind, well protected in a sphere of dark energy, as he goes searching for the Pharaoh to end his life once and for all.
- As he looks for the Pharaoh, suddenly Karim steps out from the side of a building and stands in Akhenaden's way, saying that he will save his friend Seto from his evil influence. The two of them battle in a **duel**, but Karim was already wounded from the previous fight and is defeated. Shada and Isis arrive to see his final moments, as he dies in their arms. The two of them cry and stand up to fight Akhenaden, but he is nowhere to be seen.
- Akhenaden returns to his palace and dispell the dark cloud as he speaks to Seto. He is still corrupting his mind and begging him to accept his new role as the true Pharaoh, and Seto looks shaken. Suddenly, Kisara arrives followed soon after by Kaiba who hides behind a column to watch. Kisara warns Seto that he should not listen to him. She and Akhnaden **clash** as they summon their powerful magic. 
- Her dragon is incredibly strong, even for him, but she herself is vulnerable and Akhenaden knocks her back with his magic. Then, he tries to imprison the White Dragon in a stone tablet so Seto can finally take control of it, but Seto snaps out of the spell and finally enters the frey. He claims that Kisara and him are not his tools for revenge, and that the father he used to be proud of died long ago in the battlefield. 
- With rage, Akhenaden sends an energy blast towards Seto. Kisara gets in the way to intercept the attack and is struck down. The White Dragon is then finally absorbed into the tablet. The Evil Priest asks Seto to join him one more time. Seto declares his father died when he was young, and then proceeds to use his sword to stab Akhenaden in the heart, as his monster does the same on Akhenaden's monster to finish the duel. As he dies, Akhenaden professes the strong love than unites him with his son and tansfers his spirit within Seto's mind, so that together they may become the Dark King, but a white female figure protects his mind before turning into the shape of the White Dragon. Together, Kisara and Seto destroy Akhenaden's darkness once and for all, freeing his mind.
- The Pharaoh (who got word some time ago that Akhenaden's creatures were causing chaos in the city) arrives to see a devastating scene. Seto is holding Kisara's body in his arms, kneeling in front of the White Dragon statue, in the exact same vision that Kaiba saw back in Domino City.
- Kaiba comes out of his hiding place and meets the Pharaoh, who can see him. Kaiba merely comments that if he were to trust the 'occult' stuff, he'd assumed this is the world of memories he was talking about. He also admits that what's transpired looked somewhat different to his vision, to which the Pharaoh admits that some events have been altered because this is a Dark Game controlled by Bakura. Yami tries to suggest him to escape, since Zorc is about to be ressurected, but Kaiba, as always, claims to go his own way and admits wanting to see what kind of being this terryfing 'Evil God' really is.
- Seto stands up and looks at the Pharaoh. He doesn't seem to be able to see Kaiba standing besides him. Suddenly, Seto challenges the Pharaoh to a **duel** and summons his White Dragon. The Pharaoh is shocked by this and asks if Akhenaden is still controlling him, but Seto simply attacks, forcing the Pharaoh to dodge and summon Mahad, the Dark Magician. The two of them stand in front of each other, in a very similar image of what Kaiba and the Other Yugi saw back in the Battle City finals. Seto asks the Pharaoh a simple thing: is he ready to face the absolute darkness that is coming? He has seen it, he has seen what is coming, what Akhenaden showed him. A world plunged into the most absolute darkness. To prevent that catastrophe, everything seem to rest on the shoulders of one man. Is he strong enough to endure the storm, or will he be engulfed by it? Is he the one who should protect his people? Or would he need to step up to that role?
- The White Dragon attacks and destroys the Dark Magician, inflicting the Pharaoh with damage. And yet he stands, taking it, without falling. The powerful blast of light puts his life at risk, but he stood his ground, and that seems to be enough for Seto, who bends the knee and apologises. The Pharaoh extends his hand towards him, stating to his friend that there is nothing to apologise for, and saying that he is truly sorry as he looks towards Kisara.
- As Kaiba looks at the two of them, the words of Ishizu during the Battle City finals resonate on his mind. They speak about a prayer named *"pert kertu"* inscripted in the tablet of the lost memories. A message that the Priest inscribed to his true friend, the late Pharaoh:
- *“The corpse sinks to the floor. The vessel becomes sand, becomes dust. Even the brightest gold, even the sharpest sword is wrapped in the sheath of time. Woe to the Pharaoh, for his body lacks even his name. Time is a battlefield of souls. I cry the song of battle, the song of a friend. To the place far away where souls meet… guide me.”*

## Episode 134 - The Great Evil God is Resurrected

![](/img/storyimg/ep0134.jpg)

---

- The faceoff between the Pharaoh and Seto has just transpired. Meanwhile, the Other Yugi and the Evil Bakura are in front of their Dark RPG board, discussing the precarious situation Yugi is in. Bakura stars laughing, amused at the whole thing. He never thought his Dark Priest could lose, but it doesn't matter as Zorc is about to be resurrected. The Other Yugi looks at his empty cartouche and Bakura smile, saying that it seems that he has finally realized that the secret of Zorc's seal was his name. The Other Yugi replies that his partner will find it, but Bakura replies that his "servant" will annihilate them at the instant they find the name. 
- Back at the "Valley of the Kings", Yugi and his friends have entered the ancient tomb. They cannot pass through walls here. One by one, they get past all the traps (the "Needle-Spitting Snake Statues", the "Maze Across the Pit of Obscurity" and "The Monster Bridge" as Yugi remembered). As they reach the room where the Millennium Puzzle was stored, they seem to be at a dead end. However Jonouchi casually leans against a pressure-sensitive panel on the wall and activates a secret door.
- The Pharaoh and Seto reunite with the other priests as a dark shadow covers the entire kingdom. The last sand of the hourglass in the main game drops at last, so Zorc Necrophades finally revives. The force of his arrival destroys the village, scattering the Millennium Items all around the ruins. Zorc starts showcasing his power and wreaking destruction upon the land. It doesn't take long for him to arrive. As he approaches the capital, Seto orders the catapults to attack, but they disintegrate before they reach Zorc. Zorc counter-attacks and wipes out part of the Pharaoh's troops. Seto orders them to retreat to the Royal Palace.
- Suddenly at the Dark RPG table, the other Yugi sees visions of modern times where the entire world seem to be affected by natural catastrophes. Bakura states that the world of memories and the real world have begun to merge. Bakura states that his plan was to use the Eight Key to resurrect Zorc into the real world, but it seems that it won't be necessary anymore as with the two worlds connected, Zorc will be able to destroy the real world from the world of memories directly.
- The Priests summon their monsters to protect the city. None of the attacks seem to phase Zorc, and his counter-attack is ruthless. Siamun says that the only way they can stand a chance is if the three Egyptian Gods are summoned, but the Pharaoh has lost his Millennium Puzzle and his life energy is too low. Isis suggest they must go out to the desert and search for the Millennium Items. While the Pharaoh's troops create a diversion, Isis summons a monster and departs with Mana to look for them.
- Zorc easily defeats the human soldiers and destroys part of the palace. As the priests try to evacuate the people, Shada stands his ground and **fights** Zorc directly using his Ka. Sadly, he is no match. He is struck down and dies in battle.
- Zorc attacks the Pharaoh but Hasan **steps** into the way one more time. His golden mask breaks under the pressure and his face is revealed. The Pharaoh is surprised to see that Hasan was actually Anubis. Hasan states that he has been the protector of Egypt ever since the Millennium Items were created, as he was one of the guards mind-controlled by Akhenaden that participated in the Kul Elna's massacre. He was the only one who survived and break free from the mind-control when he touched the Tablet of the Millennium Items by accident. His fate at that point was sealed, and he became the protector of the items as some weird light entered his body, adopting a new name given to him by the egyptian god of funerary rites himself.
- As he fends against Zorc, a small blue pyramid appears in his neck, shining and giving him new strength. Hasan says that he won't be able to endure the fight for long, but asks the Pharaoh to never give up, saying that the light of hope in which he believes will surely show up in the time of need. With that, Zorc manages to overrun him and defeat him, destroying Hasan completely. The explosion sends everyone flying away, and the small blue pyramid flies off towards some collapsing building, ending buried beneath the debris.

## Episode 135 - The Legendary Guardian God

![](/img/storyimg/ep0135.jpg)

---

- Back at the ruins of Kul Elna, Isis and Mana see the devastation but find the Millennium Items almost immediately, as if their powers were calling for them. As they return to the capital, Zorc senses the presence of the items and immediately attack Isis. She tells Mana to dismount and bring the items back to the Pharaoh. Meanwhile, she uses her Millennium Necklace to empower his monsters and create a diversion by **attacking** Zorc. She cannot fight him for long, and with a final strike Zorc ends her life too.
- Mana is running towards the Royal Palace, crying after feeling the death of Isis. She is intercepted by Siamun Muran, who takes the Millennium Key from her in order to buy them more time.
- Siamun uses the Millennium Item that belonged to him in the past to summon the legendary protector of egypt: Exodia. Zorc **attacks** him but Exodia is strong and is holding his own against Zorc. However, even if Exodia is powerful enough to match Zorc, he is summoned by a human mage. Zorc attacks Siamun, taking advantage of that to finally destroy Exodia and kill his summoner.
- At this point, Mana brings back the Items and the Pharaoh takes the Millennium Puzzle. His life energy is replenished.
- Back in the Valley of the Kings, Yugi and his friends got across a secret passage into a room that is empty, except for a large sign in the floor written in hieroglyphics. Honda, who is controlled by Bakura, is able to read it and he reads: *"He who solves the Millennium Puzzle must return the wish that he was granted. Only then the door shall be opened"*. However Yugi states that the wish can never be given back. He wished for "true friends" and that wish was granted by meeting them and becoming inseparable. Suddenly, Honda throws the others on opposite sides of the floor sign. The room starts crumbling, and the sign then becomes a "balance beam" standing over a pit of shadows with Yugi on one end and the three of them on another. A room containing the Pharaoh's name opens up behind Yugi.
- Therefore, Yugi's choice is simple. If he wants to retrieve the name he must jump towards the door. In doing so, his friends will fall to their doom, thus giving up his wish. Yugi refuses to make that choice. Honda then jumps and the balance starts to topple. Jonouchi and Anzu jump off, with Yugi shortly after. The three of them are safe but Honda has disappeared. However Yugi and his friends have found the Pharaoh's name! It's in hyeroglyphics, but the three friends memorize the symbols to tell the Pharaoh later and walk down a set of stairs in order to find Honda. 
- They soon find him in another room, yet he reveals himself as the Evil Bakura, changing his appearance. Bakura challenges Yugi to a duel, and two Duel Disks suddenly appear on their arms.

## Episode 136 - For My Other Me!

![](/img/storyimg/ep0136.jpg)

- Yugi steps up to the challenge and faces Bakura in a **duel** that could decide everything. He uses his own deck of cards, with his own strategies. Bakura's deck is really strong and manages to put him in a very bad predicament, but Yugi is able to fight off and eventually vanquish his opponent, breaking the tactics and winning the duel.
- As Bakura spirit vanishes, Honda's body is released. But then, the tomb begin to collapse. They find a way out, but soodenly they are attacked by Thief King Bakura's enigmatic riders. Honda surprise everyone by charging towards them, and knocks one down from his horse, claiming that he has to redeem himself from being possessed once again. Jonouchi runs forth to help his friend, but a rider swings his scimitar towards him. He instinctively protects himself and a Duel Disk appears in his arm, deflecting the blade.
- They realize that what they imagine in this world becomes a reality, and thus Duel Disk appear in their arms. Summoning monsters, Yugi's friends **fight back** and defeat the riders. Then, they visualize on reaching to the Other Yugi to help him. The four of them start floating and then fly away, towards the capital city where the Pharaoh is.

## Episode 137 - Summon! The Three Egyptian Gods

![](/img/storyimg/ep0137.jpg)

---

- The Pharaoh just retrieved his Millennium Puzzle. His energy is replenished and he calls upon the three Divine Beasts to **battle** Zorc.
- Meanwhile, back at the Dark RPG table, Bakura states that they don't need the table anymore. The outcome of that battle will decide the fate of the world. He says that he doesn't need that body anymore and that he will go back to his true form. The Other Yugi finally confirms that the evil spirit possessing Bakura is actually Zorc. Their two souls disappear from the Dark RPG, entering respectively to the bodies of Zorc and the Pharaoh in the world of memories.
- The fight is intense, and the power of the three gods together seem to destroy the body of Zorc. Kaiba, who hasn't missed anything, looks baffled at the situation unfolding. Ra flies out of a tornado of flames, resuming its normal form. The skies begin to clear and the sun comes out. Everyone claims victory, but the Pharaoh keeps on looking serious and is sure that it wasn't enough.
- Zorc emerges from his crater and shifts the moon, provoking a solar eclipse. The light is gone and Egypt is covered in complete darkness. The Pharaoh order his gods to attack once again before the light is gone, however Zorc counter-attacks and destroy all three gods one after the other. Seeing this, the Egyptian troops have lost all hope and flee in disarray, despite Seto's orders to remain and fight.
- Seto orders Mana to protect the Pharaoh and then charges against Zorc himself. The White Dragon manages to push Zorc to the ground, destroying its body. However, the dark being regenerate and counter-attacks, grabbing the dragon by the neck and turning it into stone like the Egyptian Gods. Seto falls to the ground and is knocked out.
- With no one left to oppose him, Zorc starts wreaking havoc and destruction. Two children (who look like young versions of Mokuba and Seto Kaiba) are killed by Zorc's attack, which sends Kaiba over the edge. A duel disk appears around his arm, and he summons Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Zorc is surprised at seeing him there. Kaiba fuses the Blue-Eyes with two others to bring forth the Ultimate Blue-Eyes White Dragon. The spirits of Kisara and Seto join together in the fusion, and the blast is strong enough to push Zorc all away to the outskirts of the city. 
- Meanwhile, in the real world Mokuba has made the trip to Egypt in search for his brother. While trying to reach him on the radio inside te plane cockpit, he sees a vision in the sky of Kaiba's battling against Zorc, the Blue-Eyes Ultimate and the world of memories.
- The Pharaoh wakes up and sees that Mana is healing him with magic. He stands up and sees the clash of powers between the dragon and Zorc. He realizes what is going on: only one person is able to Summon "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", and that is Seto Kaiba. He takes the Millennium Scale from Mana's bag and requests of Karim to lend his strength. The iconic armor of the Chaos Soldier appears on him, as he is surrounded by a beam of light and fuses with Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to become Master of Dragon Knight. He and Kaiba shout together and the fusion immediately attacks. The blast is so strong that it's light radiates through space. The fusion is undone and the Pharaoh and Kaiba are on one knee, gasping for air, but Zorc somehow is still standing.

## Episode 138 - In the Name of the Pharaoh!

![](/img/storyimg/ep0138.jpg)

---

- In the real world, in front of the tablet of lost memories, the unconscious bodies of Kaiba, Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu and Honda are in the floor. Standing near them, Pegasus, Sugoroku, Marik, Ishizu and Fizdis are using their Millennium Items towards them but stress and sweat are visible on their faces. A swirl of dark energy is covering the tablet, and there are cracks forming on the floor and the ceiling. There is not much time left.
- Zorc is still standing after the powerful attack. He then explains to the Pharaoh that at the beginning the world was formed from darkness, and it was *then* that the light was created. He states that in the end, darkness will always exceed light, that that is the fate of the world. But foolish humans fear the darkness. They cling to the light with what they label "hope". Powerless as they all are, they cling to the tiny scraps of this light with all they have. This light, Zorc says, is the Nameless Pharaoh. A mere speck of a soul like him never had a chance of deafeating him, the powerful Zorc. The Pharaoh replies that even if his light is extinguished, someone will inherit this light of his soul and use it until Zorc is finally defeated.
- But the reality shows otherwise. It seems as if Zorc has finally triumphed: all of the Pharaoh's Priests are gone, his troops have deserted him, and the city is in ruins. Zorc says that the darkness in humans is what gives him eternal power, that's why he will always win. In the midst of light, the only way for mankind to know themselves is to turn to the darkness and see their own shadow. Therefore he will create a world of eternal darkness. The Pharaoh screams for him to shut up, but collapses due to exhaustion. 
- Zorc is ready to deliver the final blow, the Pharaoh screams "Partner!" calling for Yugi. Just then, Yugi and his friends arrive "flying" and tell him that they possess the knowledge of his true name. Zorc attacks them but they dodge the attacks and summon their ace monsters to fight (Mahado the Black Magician for Yugi, Red-Eyes Black Dragon for Jonouchi, Fire Sorceress for Anzu and Rare Metal Knight for Honda). The riders appear on the horizon again and turn into flying undead-like monsters, used by Zorc to attack them. Yugi and the rest use their monsters to destroy them, but they keep regenerating. Suddenly, "Dark Magician Girl" appears. She's been summoned by Mana. She and Mahado remain to battle the Riders, while Yugi & his friends land to help out the Pharaoh.
- Yugi and his friends want to tell the Pharaoh his name, but there's a problem: it was written in ancient hieroglyphics so they could not interpret its meaning. Zorc starts laughing having realized what's going on. He then destroy his ace monsters one by one, inflicting serious damage to them. Both the Dark Magician and the Dark Magician Girl are destroyed after a fierce resistance, which knocks Mana out.
- Just then, Anzu realizes how they can help the Pharaoh remember his name. She bets that if they concentrate on visualizating hard enough they can make the hieroglyphic symbols appear on the cartouche around his neck, the cartouche she gifted him way back. They start to do that and the symbols start to show up but Zorc won't let them do as they please. Kaiba, who was unconscious nearby, wake up and stops the attack with his cards, allowing them to finish the visualization. And then, it works!
- The Pharaoh reveal his true name: "Atem". The eight key has been found, and the final seal is broken. With that, Pharaoh Atem summons the three Egyptian Gods once again using the cards in Yugi's deck, and then he merge their energies, forming the ultimate monster: The Creator God of Light, Horakhty. Her shining attack is the true pure light at the beginning of time, and with it she destroys Zorc Necrophades and the evil Bakura once and for all.
- In the present, the world returns to normal.
- The group celebrate as they have finally defeated Zorc. Horakhty then speaks with Atem, explaining that three thousand years ago he defeated Zorc with his strength alone, but wasn't able to destroy it so he choose to seal himself along with Zorc in the Puzzle. But when Zorc revived this time, he had friends and comrades who cared for him and protected him. That was the only way to truly defeat Zorc. If one person's strength alone is not enought, by combining the power of everyone, the impossible may become possible. As she says these final words, she vanishes into the air.
- Atem ponders about his own name, as it feels a bit strange after carrying the name "Yugi" from his partner all this time. But now things are different, and he has finally become his own self. Yugi realizes this too, thinking that he is himself now, and Atem is nobody but himself. It's kinda sad but he is glad for him.
- Some time later, the rebuilding of the Egyptial capital can finally begin. The Pharaoh and Seto look on the repairs from the Royal Palace's balcony, as they talk about the cost they had to pay to vanquish the darkness, and the lives that were lost during the battle. Atem then asks a favor to Seto: he wants him to inherit his throne and become the new Pharaoh.
- Seto is surprised by this and asks him why. Atem says that he is no longer needed in this world, and as proof his body is starting to become transluscent. He thinks to himself that from that point on he has no memories, so he cannot exist anymore in this world. Atem says to him that he never lost the light of his soul, as the Dark Priest wasn't able to possess him, he triumphed over the dark in a splendid manner. He then hands him his Millennium Puzzle and says that he's counting on him as the new Pharaoh. Seto picks it up.
- Atem and the rest then "fly up" towards the inverted pyramid in the sky to return to the "real world". Mana waves them goodbye with tears on her eyes and keeps on calling Atem "prince". Seto looks at the skies and reflects upon the duty which has been given to him, as the iamge of Kisara, the light of his soul, and the White Dragon accompanies him.

## Episode 139 - The Final Journey

![](/img/storyimg/ep0139.jpg)

---

- The group returns to the present and re-enter their bodies. In front of them, Pegasus and the rest are waiting for them and help them get on their feet. Yugi grabs his Millennium Puzzle and is happy to confirm that the Pharaoh still lives in there and within his heart. Everything is the same as before, except that Zorc has been defeated and the Pharaoh now knows his real name.
- Atem thinks of Seto, and while the memory world and the real world are separate things, after he was originally sealed into the Millennium Puzzle he can tell that Seto became a great Pharaoh who protected the land and would later engrave that Tablet of Lost Memories for him, his friend. 
- Kaiba knows that what happened wasn't a dream, and ponders about Kisara and his other self back there in the time of ancient egypt. Nevertheless, he is always looking at the future. He attempts to leave the place but he meets the "good" Bakura, who has just showed up in the middle of the stairs, is in a confused state and almost faints in the arms of Jonouchi. He feels rather hungry and the only things he vaguely remembers is something chasing him. Atem then takes the Millennium Ring from around his neck, and senses that the evil has vanished completely from the Millennium Ring at last.
- The previous Millennium Item wielders return all the Millennium Items to him, and he gathers them all in the bag he used to bring them to Egypt in the first place. Atem announces that his last mission is to seal the items so that no one can get their hands on them ever again. Anzu is concerned because she knows that doing that would mean that Atem's soul would have to go back to the afterlife. Everyone stay silent after her words. Ishizu and Marik look at each other and nod.
- Ishizu explains that there is the Temple of the Realm of the Dead which the Tomb Keepers have been protecting, and within it lies the Tablet of the Realm of the Dead (the place where the Millennium Items originally came). That temple has an engraving with the following words: "Placing the seven Millennium Items here will connect the Door to the Afterlife. The final necessary key to open it is the Pharaoh's name". Everyone follows up: the Pharaoh's name is Atem. Ishizu announces that all conditions have been met. She asks of Atem if he wants to continue with his decision. Atem merely nods in agreement. She then announces that they'll guide them to the Temple of the Realm of the Dead.
- They all go to Cairo's port as they will be travelling by boat. Ishizu mentions that back in the Ancient Egypt era it was believed that ships were the way for the Pharaoh to transcend from the living world to the Realm of the Dead. They believed that the Afterlife was located only at the sunset, so since they were taking a ship to the west, it may hold a special meaning.
- Aboard the ship the group find Mokuba and Otogi. Mokuba runs and hugs his brother, who is surprised to see him there. He explains that when he left without telling anyone, Mokuba tried to locate him and went over there by plane. Seto apologizes, saying that this was a matter that he needed to settle with his own hands no matter what.
- On the other hand, Otogi was in a business trip accompanying Pegasus on southern Europe when Pegasus suddenly decided to diverted the route to Cairo, and then he ditched him there while he did some "research on Kaiba-boy" as he said. Pegasus just laughs at this. Otogi comments that he met Mokuba at the city airport and weren't able to find them until they got a message from Rishid about the boat location. Rishid nods with a slight smile, saying that is good for friends and family to be together in the important moments. Ishizu and Marik smile at him.
- Pegasus then talks directly to Atem: *"It's finally time... Yugi-boy. Thinking back, it may have all been the work of fate. When I received the Millennium Eye during my trip to Egypt, and finding the stone tablet in which i got the hints to create Duel Monsters. All of it was for this day. I bet fate was leading me to you"*. Atem smiles and nods, agreeing with him.
- A montage of images follows showing Mai, Rebecca and Arthur, Ryuzaki and Haga, Kajiki, Shizuka, Yako and Gekko, Amelda, Valon, Rafael. This happens as Otogi comments that he alerted "the others" while on his wait in the city, meaning all the people who were involved with Yugi-kun in some way. Since he contacted them at the last minute there wasn't enough time for them to come, but he is sure that they are all thinking about him, no matter where they are. 
- Back on the boat, Yugi and his friends have started their journey towards the final resting place of the Tablet of the Realm of the Dead. The sun is setting casting a bright orange color that is both beautiful and also a bit sad. Jonouchi asks why Kaiba and Mokuba are going with them. Ishizu intercedes by saying that he is hoping to bring his involvement in all of this to an end, as one of those wound up in this destiny like all of them there.
- Marik then tells Yugi that he needs to explain one last thing. There is something else written on the epitaph in the Temple of the Realm of the Dead, that talks about the "Rite of the Duel". He explains that *"the Pharaoh's soul cannot start his homeward journey to eternal rest while still holding his sword"*. They realise that this mean that someone would have to defeat the Pharaoh in battle, more specifically (because they are duelists), defeat him with cards in a duel.
- They think about it as the night falls. Marik and the rest leave for a bit, leaving only Yugi, Anzu, Honda, Jonouchi and Otogi on the ship deck. Inside the boat, Marik, Ishizu and Rishid talk about what are they going to do next. This ceremony would officially mark the end of their long work as Tomb Keepers. Marik comments that he has crimes to atone for, specially regarding the Ghouls, but after that he wants to live free and duel on his bike exploring the world. Rishid smiles saying that he will follow him anywhere. Ishizu wants to preserve the history of what happened and also wants to turn this whole tale into a story that can endure time, like the egyptians did.
- In the dining area of the boat, Fizdis approaches Pegasus who is sitting enjoying some wine. Her dog, Anubis, puts himself infront of her in a defensive posture, but she just scratches his head and says that is alright. She just want to talk with him about his father. As they talk, Pegasus apologises for what happened to his father, remembering the photograph and saying that his passing was his own fault as he didn't knew that taking pictures of the gods would draw their fury. He hopes she can forgive him. Sugoroku is watching all of this from afar and smiles.
- Back at the ship dock, Jonouchi says that sailing under the stars like this reminds him of Duelist Kingdom. Jonouchi then says that he wants to face Atem. Kaiba steps in and says that he is the one who should duel him instead, to finally settle the score. They start fighting, and Yugi steps in to tell them that he is alright in saying that he has been constantly fighting against his other self all this time, but he has already made up his mind: HE will be the one challenging the Pharaoh for the final duel. He can't let anyone else do this, it has to be him. Jonouchi gets it, but Kaiba does not and grabs him by the shirt, saying there is no way in hell someone like him could beat the other Yugi. But seeing his determination, he releases him and grudgingly offers him his help, giving him a full case of the most powerful cards to reinforce his deck. But Yugi refuses once again, saying that he will use his usual cards, the one that he and Atem used together.
- Later on while preparing his Deck inside his cabin, Yugi receives a visit from Anzu: she is having a hard time accepting the idea of the Pharaoh leaving but she doesn't voice it aloud. They talk for a bit about the upcoming duel. Yugi explains to her that Atem is hiding in the depths of his heart for now while he builds his deck, so neither of them can see which deck the other build. She realises that both of them have decided to go through with this. After her visit, Yugi understand her hidden feelings and knows that she wanted to see with his other self. He silently apologises to her. She, on the other side of the door, tries to convince herself that Atem does not belong to that era and has a place to return, his original home. She knows she shouldn't try to stop him, but cannot avoid crying.
- Yugi reflects on his entire journey so far. On how their paths crossed and the adventures they had. He thinks to himself that if he hadn't taken Atem into his heart that day, he would probably still be trapped in the puzzle. And he himself got more courageous after being with him, that's why he has to do this for him, he will use all his strength to help him now.
- In the ship dock, Jonouchi is looking at the horizon. Honda and Otogi ask if he is okay with all of that, as this is the final chance to duel the other Yugi. Jonouchi says that back then he was still too weak. But all that came to an end. While fighting him he had some fun duels and got stronger. He admits he made the guy his goal, and that's why he want to do what he wants. He knows that Yugi is the only one who can take him on. 
- A series of brief scenes of the others on board are shown. In his cabin, Kaiba is thinking that Atem is likely to use the gods, and wonders how will Yugi fight them. In the dining area, Bakura is eating a lot of food. Sugoroku is unable to sleep in his own cabin. Ishizu also cannot sleep and turns to the side of the bed. Rishid is completely awake, his back against the wall. Marik is also awake, in his bed staring at the ceiling with the arms behind his head. Fizdis is petting her dog and looking through the window. Pegasus is looking at a card of Cyndia with tearful eyes.
- Yugi finishes building his deck for the duel, after which the spirit of the Pharaoh appears, saying that he hid in the corners of his mind to give him complete privacy while building his deck. He thanks him for taking on his final trial. It is time for him to build his own deck. Yugi touches the Millennium Puzzle and lets Atem take control. Yugi thinks to himself that in truth he doesn't want to fight him, but if he doesn't, he knows that Atem will never be free and will always be trapped in his heart, therefore defeating him is his duty. The Pharaoh thinks to himself that he has fought many enemies along the way, but this will be by far the hardest duel he has ever faced.
- The next morning, the boat arrives at its destination just when Atem finishes his deck, his strongest deck ever. As he leaves the boat, he sees that all their friends are outside waiting for him.
- Ishizu guides them through the desert and into a secret door in the ground. They go down a set of stairs but Anzu stops at one point. Honda asks her what is going on. She asks why they have to rush into this so soon, and suggest that maybe they could spend a little more time with each other. Ishizu understand how difficult must be, but says that the two of them would need to carry out the Battle Ritual as quickly as possible while the strength of the duelists is at their absolute peak. And that day is today, after they have defeated the Wicked God and regained his memories. If too much time passes, their window of opportunity will close and Atem would have to wander in the present forever. Yugi admits it's tough for him too, but his other self has decided they must go through with this. Anzu admits they are right and apologises. Jonouchi says that she said out loud what all of them were thinking but couldn't say. Kaiba however says that they better not start thinking of canceling this fight. Yugi smiles and they continue.
- Soon they reach the cavern where the Tablet of the Realm of the Dead lies, before a doorway with hieroglyphics and the Eye of Wdjat carved into it. Ishizu calls Yugi over and asks him to place the Millennium Items in the slabs if he accepts this rite of duel. He nods and puts one by one every Millennium Item in the proper slot, leaving his Millennium Puzzle for last. Sugoroku thinks that all this began the day Yugi solved that Puzzle, and it will now end the moment he returns it. Yugi thanks the Puzzle for fulfiling his wish of granting him friends, places it into the slot and then he stands up.
- The Millennium Items start to glow and waves of light flash around the tablet. Then a light shines from the Eye of Wdjat onto Yugi. Two shadow form behind Yugi instead of one, and then his body splits into two. Atem and Yugi look at each other and then walk to opposite sides of the cavern.

## Episode 140 - The Story which Concludes inside the Light

![](/img/storyimg/ep0140.jpg)

---


- The **final duel between Yugi and Atem** then begins. Mokuba wonders which one they're supposed to root for. Anzu thinks that if the Pharaoh wins he can stay and they won't have to say goodbye, but Jonouchi declares that they've got to root for Yugi, as it's the only way to set the Pharaoh's spirit free to the Afterlife. Anzu realizes that Jonouchi is right and while it's hard to say goodbye, she says that she'll root for Yugi. Kaiba thinks to himself that this is a match betting the title of Duel King: the ultimate battle.
- The fight starts with intensity, as Atem quickly takes control. Yugi stops his attacks and sets up a strong defense. Atem says that he can't beat him with a high guard alone, and uses his tactics to summon his first Egyptian God. However, Yugi is smiling at this. Jonouchi understand that Yugi is enjoying the duel, and mentally asks him to show him his true strength. Yugi attempts a counterplay that partially works but is skillfully stopped by Atem, who in turn makes a new play to have not one, not two, but all three Egyptian Gods onto the field.
- This terrifies everyone, as Atem proves to be, without a doubt, the strongest duelist with the strongest cards on the field. Kaiba then declares that the outcome of this duel is over and attempts to leave. Jonouchi tries to stop him, but Kaiba replies by asking him what strategy would he use to defeat all three gods on the field at the same time? It's impossible, he says. There is none. Jonouchi protest saying there must be one, and asks Marik, who says that individually the gods have some weaknesses, not many, and one of them is their summoning conditions, but once they are all on the field then it's practically over. Ishizu argues that this may be an act guided by fate, that after three thousand years the Pharaoh's sword has become too strong to be defeated at the height of his powers.
- Kaiba tells Mokuba that they are leaving, but Yugi asks him to wait. He wants for Kaiba to watch the duel until the very end, because he should be there when Atem leaves to the afterlife due to the connection the two of them have. This shocks Kaiba, who sees that he is serious on defeating all three gods on the field. 
- The duel continues. The God's pressure seems too strong, and Yugi is hesitant to draw his next card. Atem states that he can see the uncertainty in Yugi's eyes. If Yugi expects to win this duel, first he must overcome his self-doubt. Yugi looks surprised, as the Pharaoh says he believes this is why fate brought them together, so that Yugi could learn to trust in himself, and be the Duelist he truly is inside, and so that Atem could learn from Yugi. Yugi confirms he spent the entire time he built his Deck thinking about Atem, how he mustered the courage to face countless obstacles, and Atem confirms he did as well, stating that his kindness is his strength, as Yugi would rather be hurt than hurt others, remembering how Yugi stopped him from killing Kaiba during their Duel atop Pegasus Castle. Each of them has given the other a gift, like bravery, Yugi states, and Atem adds, like kindness, sympathy, and heart. Yugi realizes that even though they've separated, they've each maintained the other's strengths, and those strengths are represented in their Decks. Atem agrees and Yugi silently thanks his other self, as he's no longer afraid. 
- Yugi tells his other self that he's coming, and Atem tells him to bring it on. Yugi draws and continues to duel. He defends well against the gods but Atem not only relies on them but also on his other cards. At the most important point, Yugi manages to correctly predict the face-down card Atem had on the field and after a series of very impressive plays and counterplays, he is able to pull a miracle and defeat all three Egyptian Gods one after another.
- Everyone watching is astonished. Yugi managed to defeat the gods. Bakura and Sugoroku start dancing in a circle while the others discuss what an impressive move that was. But Atem quickly recovers and builds up his advantage once again. Mokuba gasps that Atem is strong, believing he has the upper hand again even after losing the god cards. But Kaiba tells him he's wrong: Yugi may have fewer life points, but he managed to come up with an unprecedented strategy to defeat the Egyptian God cards, and Kaiba's never seen anything like that before. He declares the battle has turned in Yugi's favor, and admits he believes what Yugi said now, that he can win. Surprised, but pleased at Kaiba's words, Yugi asks Kaiba if he really means it, while Jonouchi is shocked that Kaiba is rooting for Yugi.
- As the battle continues, their most iconic monsters of all time fight one against the other. At one point Atem does a move that confirms one thing: that the current situation fell within his predictions, he knew that Yugi would be able to defeat the three gods and he prepared himself in advance for that scenario. He knew that his partner was that strong, able to perform a miracle. He says that the actual battle began after the gods were defeated.
- Atem is pushed to his limits and even beyond. He says that he has never before felt such fear in a duel up until now, but he is also enjoying this match. He calls Yugi the greatest rival and friend of his entire life. Then, he thinks to himself that the only way to win is to believe in his deck and, as if it were fate itself, he starts to draw the exact card he needs and plays it without looking at it, accurately calling its name before even drawing it. This seem insane to the spectators, and Ishizu interprets it as the Pharaoh molding fate itself in his favor, guiding his own destiny, being so connected to his deck that he is able to perfectly draw exactly what he needs at the right time. 
- As Yugi gains the advantage once again, Anzu turns her back to the fight saying that she cannot watch anymore. After seeing their duel so far, she doesn't believe Atem wants to go, so why do they have to fight? Jonouchi walks to her and says that they aren't fighting for personal reasons anymore. Their duelist's souls have been absorbed into their decks. They have battled many duelists to reach this point, their souls carved into their decks aswell. He is sure that they aren't thinking about Atem returning to the afterlife anymore. They are lost within the duel, their souls push them to battle, to fight with everything they have no matter what's ahead of them. He puts a hand on her shoulder, stating that no-one can stop that duel and while painful, there's nothing they can do, but as their friends they need to watch until the end. Anzu wipes her tears and agrees.
- Atem feels his next draw and calls forth Mahado to the field, his Dark Magician. Yugi then has to defeat his most trusted card. Atem turns the flow of battle once again. The duel is reaching its end. Yugi admits to himself that he has to make a gamble, and declares a card to be sealed in the Gold Sarcophagus.
- In his final turn, Atem activates Resurrection of the Dead to bring back Osiris to the field, ready to win the duel with it. Everyone can only watch, speechless, as Atem tells Yugi that the whole duel was impressive, and thanks him for fighting with courage trying everything in his power, but unfortunately, this Duel will end with his victory. But Yugi's eyes are closed, and he thinks that he knew his other self was going to do that: if he were Atem, he would have summoned an Egyptian God, too. The Sarcophagus starts to shine and it is revealed that the sealed card within it is the card Atem just played: Resurrection of the Dead. This negates its activation, sealing the fight. Ishizu thinks that this is it, the final message from Yugi to Atem: the souls of the dead must not linger in the world of the living.
- Atem is wide open and smiles, thinking that his partner figured out his trump card and has surpassed him. Yugi cries, understanding what he is about to do, and then uses his Silent Magician to end the duel. Atem's life points drop to zero, and Yugi is the winner.
- Yugi falls to his knees, weeping. Atem walks to him and puts a hand on his shoulder, telling him to stand up, as the winner shouldn't be on his knees. Yugi confess that he is too weak and that he has always been his goal, to be strong like him. Atem replies that Yugi was never weak, as he had a power that no one else could beat: a strength called kindness. That's what he learned from him. The courage he showed accepting this Duel Ceremony is what showed him the path he must take. Yugi calls Atem his other self again, but Atem tells Yugi that he isn't his other self anymore: Yugi is Yugi, the only Yugi Muto in the world.
- The Eye of Wdjat in the doorway begins to glow. Through the Rite of the Duel it has seen through the Pharaoh's soul. After 3000 years of being lost in the world of the living, the time has come for the Pharaoh's soul to be welcomed into the next world. Atems walks to stand in front of the door and declares his name. Light cracks the middle of the door as it opens to a white emptiness, with a powerful wind blowing through the light behind the door.
- Atem starts walking to the light but Anzu, Jonouchi and Honda call Yugi's name, sprinting to the platform. Atem stops as Yugi too runs in line with the door. Honda protest that he doesn't have to go to the afterlife and begs him not to go. They all wipe their tears. Anzu says that she understand his home on the other side of that light, but for them it will be a wall that separates them. She can't grasp that their friend will vanish before their eyes after all this time together. Jonouchi says that she doesn't have to understand it, neither does he, but they must burn the time they spent together with him and their feelings into their memories so they'll never forget. Tears begins flowing down his cheeks as he suggests they see Atem on his way to his future, and he smiles.
- Atem thinks "Everyone..." and Anzu thinks that she'll never forget him. Jonouchi calls out to Atem again, calling him "Yugi" and telling him that he'll always be Yugi to him even if he's the Pharaoh or Atem, and he'll still be their friend even if a thousand years passes. Atem turns to them with a smile and agrees, and Yugi tells Atem they'll never forget him. 
- Raising a "thumbs up", Atem walks into the light, and everyone watches silently. As Atem steps through the door, his clothing and appearance change back to those of his past self, and beyond him the spirits of his friends and family from Egypt are waiting: Karim, Shada, Isis, Mana, Siamun, the young Akhenaden, Akhenamkanen, Seto, and Mahad. Atem disappears into the light, and the door begins to close. Anzu begins to run to it, but Jonouchi puts his hand on her shoulder to stop her and shakes his head. The door slams shut and they all cry.
- Suddenly the pillars of the temple start to shake and crumble. The Tablet of the Realm of the Dead breaks and the seven Millennium Items fall to the depths. The whole place collapses and fortunately they all manage to get out unharmed. 
- Shortly after the group flies home to Japan, with Kaiba and Mokuba passing them in the Blue-Eyes White Jet, and Yugi and his friends watching out the window as it overtakes them. When they land at the airport, Rebecca and Arthur are waiting for them, Rebecca embracing Yugi to Anzu's aggravation. Jonouchi smiles, then sees Shizuka running to him too, though he has to yank back the excited Honda and Otogi by their collars with his classic grin.
- In Domino City, Ryuzaki and Haga are furiously arguing, culminating in Ryuzaki activating his Duel Disk and challenging Haga to a Duel. Kajiki sails into Domino Pier on his fishing boat, and spots the five Roba brothers waiting on the dock, the elder of them ready to duel. Kujaku Mai, back in her lighter outfit, exchanges a high five with a chinese woman dressed in yellow close as the two of them face off against the Meikyu Brothers on the Great Wall of China. Fizdis reunites with his uncle who has finally healed. Yako and Gekko greet Pegasus as he gets there and he starts to start talking about brand new ideas for the game.
- A few days later, in a beautiful morning, Sugoroku is sweeping outside the Kame Game Store. Yugi rushes out, telling his grandfather that he's leaving now, and Sugoroku tells him to take care. Jonouchi, Anzu and Honda are waiting for Yugi, greeting him as he runs to join them. As they walk, Jonouchi teases Yugi over spending all night building his Deck, and Yugi laughs it off as he looks up at the sun. He narrates that this isn't the story of a great Pharaoh. Everyone has a story of their own, and that story ends in the light. And his own story is just beginning.

*FIN*
