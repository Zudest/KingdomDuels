## What is Kingdom Duels?

**Kingdom Duels** is a fan-made variant of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game played with its own set of cards and rules, directly inspired on the gameplay of the Duelist Kingdom arc of the Duel Monsters Anime.

It’s a recreation of the thematic spirit of the Duelist Kingdom Arc from the Anime, adapting those *"weird rules"* to an actual game with fun interactions and crazy mechanics.
This game was made on an interpretation of the japanese Anime, not the Manga or the english dub. It’s mostly a nostalgic project aimed to recreate those weird moments like the iconic “Attack the Moon!”.
