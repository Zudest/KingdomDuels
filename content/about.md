## What is Kingdom Duels?

**Kingdom Duels** is a fan-made variant of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game played with its own set of cards and rules, directly inspired on the gameplay of the Duelist Kingdom arc of the Duel Monsters Anime.

It’s a recreation of the thematic spirit of the Duelist Kingdom Arc from the Anime, adapting those *"weird rules"* to an actual game with fun interactions and crazy mechanics.
This game was made on an interpretation of the japanese Anime, not the Manga or the english dub. It’s mostly a nostalgic project aimed to recreate those weird moments like the iconic “Attack the Moon!”.

## The Cards

Kingdom Duels cards have some clear differences to regular Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. These are some of the new elements you might find in this game:

## Playing the Game

[![](/img/promotion/Promo003.jpg)](/img/promotion/Promo003.jpg)

You can play **online** with [**our mod in Tabletop Simulator**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884430004) (you need to have [Tabletop Simulator in Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) to play it this way). You can use our [**Deckbuilder**](/deckbuilder/) to plan your decks and import it into Tabletop Simulator later.

Otherwise you can always try the game with a **print-and-play** approach, just [download the cards](/downloads/) and print them to play with friends!

## Card Releases

In this game, cards are released to the public in sets/packs which contains between 150 and 250 cards. Furthermore, these Sets are also sub-divided depending on what approach they have:

- **Core Sets**
    - The original cards that showed up in the Duelist Kingdom arc of the anime (from episode 1 to 40). These are as accurate as possible to the japanese version of the anime, and let you recreate duels from that season faithfully.

- **Story Sets**
    - These sets are based on [Yugioh Scrolls](/yugioh-scrolls/), which is a fan-fiction retelling of the anime that uses Kingdom Duels rules instead of the true rules.

- ***Expansion Sets (wip)***
    - *Currently in pre-planning stage.*
    - These sets provide further support for existing mechanics. They don't follow plot, duels or specific characters and are developed with the community. They are a way for fans to design cards for the main distribution of the game.

- ***Illusory Sets (wip)***
    - *Currently in pre-planning stage.*
    - These sets represent self-contained duels between characters from different yugioh series and/or even different franchises. A sort of *"What-If?"* concept for weird and unique cards, mechanics and character interactions.
