The **Kingdom Card Game (KCG)** was a card game variant to Yugioh that adapted the "crazy" rules from the first season of Yugioh Duel Monsters into a full game with unique cards and a particular ruleset. 

It was always intended to be a print-and-play game, which means that all the cards were released online and then it was up to the player to print them, gather some friends and start playing. 

KCG was a small fan project that started at the end of 2014 and went through years of hiatus until being finally finished on 2021. The project is now completed and therefore further development for it is not planned.

_The spirit of KCG lives on in **[Kingdom Duels](https://redd.it/mz3lv1)**, a full reboot of this project with a larger scope and a clear question to answer: "what would have happened if the anime kept going with all these weird rules?"_
