10 years ago today i started this project with [a post in the yugioh subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2qdbv3/ive_been_working_on_a_yugioh_variant_card_game/). I can't believe it's been a decade already! This project was a silly little hobby of mine for a long time, and i loved seeing it grow. From releasing early concepts in 2015 to the current releases past the 2024 rules rework. I've worked on it on and off for years, but im honestly really happy to have started it when i did. I want to thank everyone who helped me during this journey. Happy holidays and happy 10 years!
