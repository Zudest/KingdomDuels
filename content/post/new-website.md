We have just launched a new website! The goal with it is to consolidate everything Kingdom-Duels-related to a single place (instead of having one site for the landing information, one for the rulebook, one for downloads, one for the story, etc.)

There are still a few things missing that we will be updating in the coming days but we are happy that we will finally have a place to keep an archive of old news that we made over the years, alongside all the new updates that may come in the future.
