We have just launched this new website! The goal with it is to consolidate everything Kingdom Duels related to a single place (instead of having one site for the landing information, one for the rulebook, one for downloads, one for the story, etc.)

- **[Home](/)**: News feed which includes old news (timestamped) to keep an archive/history of this game.
- **[About](/about/)**: Brief introduction to the game and the cards with useful links and images.
- **[Rules](/rules/)**: Revamped rulebook with images and sections for easy navigation.
- **[Yugioh Scrolls](/yugioh-scrolls/)**: The story rewrite have its own dedicated page now, with sub-sections and episode navigation.
- **[Deckbuilder](/deckbuilder/)**: The deckbuilder has been integrated to the website itself.
- **[Restricted List](/restricted-list/)**: Useful quick link to check the current restricted list.
- **[Downloads](/downloads/)**: All the downloads available for the game, including cards, templates and old versions.
