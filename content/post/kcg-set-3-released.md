#### Release: 03 - King of Duelists. It's finally here!

The **King of Duelists** is the third and final Core Set for the Kingdom Card Game (KCG). It includes cards from the episode 22 up to episode 40 for a total of 93 cards (85 playable cards and 8 non-playable cards), and it covers all the way to the end of the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the Anime.

This last set was a long-standing debt that i had here (the previous set release was a whopping 5 years ago!) so i wanted to apologize that it took so long and also thank those that were and still are interested in this small project.

You will find (among other things):

* New mechanics that reflect as best as possible the events of the original show, including new Keywords and Counters.
* Ritual Monsters being introduced for the first time with their corresponding summoning conditions.
* New Alter Summon monster's mechanics: Toon Alteration, Metal Alteration and Swarm Alteration.
* Symbol Cards for a variant (and optional) way of playing the game.
* And a bunch of new cards with weird effects and combos for you to explore.

Phew! Finally!

So... What's next?

I have no idea, haha. I don't want to make promises that i may not be able to keep so that's why im calling this the "Final Core Set", the last of the ones i originally intended for this project.

That said... Are you interested in seeing this to develop even further beyond? Or do you think this is the best place to end it? **Come and talk with us about it in our Discord**: [https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4](https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4)

#### "Now! Attack the Moon!" - The fan-made Duelist Kingdom Card Game Adaptation is back

**TL;DR**: *We made a Duelist Kingdom Card Game adaptation with unique cards and rules trying to make some sense to the crazy rulings of the first season of Duel Monsters and we wanted to share it with you all.*

Five years ago I made a few posts ([here](https://redd.it/477vbh) and [here](https://redd.it/2qdbv3), among others) about the creation of a "**Duelist Kingdom Card Game**", a variant to the official YGO card game that used specific cards and rules centered around the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the anime.

The idea was to try and make some sense to the wackiness of that season and all the crazy rules that they had there, in a time before the TCG was even out and the rules for it weren't clear yet.

Some memories from the anime rules of the time that oldies like me may remember:

* Attacking the moon with Giant Soldier of Stone to reduce the tide and clear the ocean from the terrain.
* Electric attack over the wet monsters increased the attack of Demon Skull.
* Destroy the flotation ring of the Castle of Dark Illusions to bring it down and kill the monsters beneath it.
* Time monsters, Undead monsters, Toon monsters, etc.

It's been a long time since that. I did release two full sets of cards and the rules back then. The idea was for it to be a print-and-play project: Gather some friends, print the cards and have some fun. It wasn't a format but rather a card game variant since it used its own cards.

It was indeed fun, but eventually i stopped working on it and moved on. The project stayed there... kinda dead. But i had a debt over there since i never ended up releasing the final batch of cards from that arc. So, fastforward several years until now: i've recently returned and now i wanted to share with all of you the third and final core set of that game, that covers up until the end of the Duelist Kingdom Arc in the Anime on episode 40.

A few other things from our small community:

* We have a small subreddit that is still kicking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDuelistKingdom](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDuelistKingdom)
* We have an even smaller Discord Server recently started: [https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4](https://discord.gg/mn29q7qah4)
* You can check all the individual cards in this [Deviantart account](https://www.deviantart.com/rolvak/gallery/58727364/the-duelist-kingdom-card-game)
* The game has also [been ported to Tabletop Simulator by a dedicated fan](https://redd.it/lbue6z). You can play online!

Thanks for reading up until this point!

What direction we take with this project now is still unclear. It will have some revision to cards, effects and rules in the following weeks but after that is still a mystery. I would love to hear your thoughts on it.
