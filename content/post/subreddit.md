We have just launched a new subreddit: https://reddit.com/r/TheDuelistKingdom/

It's dedicated to the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game, and specifically to the fan-made project originally called KCG (Kingdom Card Game) dedicated to create a card game adaptation using the rules of the first season of the anime series.
