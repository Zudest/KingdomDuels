#### I've been working on a Yugioh variant card game based on the Duelist Kingdom rules, check it out! 

So, i've been working on something i like to call KCG (Kingdom Card Game). A variation to the TCG/OCG system that is based on the rules from the original first arc of the series (Pegasus Duelist Kingdom).

You can check a informative image in here: http://i.imgur.com/g7f29Pb.jpg

Let me now what you think about something like this. I will be uploading individual cards soon.
