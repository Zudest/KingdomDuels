Hello duelists!

A few days ago i released "**[Yugioh Scrolls](https://yugiohscrolls.wordpress.com/)**", which is a personal project of mine that i've been working on for a while.

It is a retelling of the anime that brings up the question *"what would have happened if the anime kept the weird rules beyond duelist kingdom?"* and will attempt to adapt the rest of the show (and future spinoffs) following that premise.

It will also work as the roadmap for upcoming Story Sets and cards, so in a way following that story you will know what set is going to be coming next, as that is the way we release new cards for the most part.
