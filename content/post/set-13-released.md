- It provides support for the following duelists: Shadi, Kanekura, Yugi, Yoshimori, Priest Seto, Pharaoh Servant.
- Introduces a new terrain: "Temple".
- Introduces the very first "Subduel" mechanic interactions.

#### Other Updates

- Check our recent [**changes to terrains**](/post/terrain-changes/).
- We are changing how frequently we update the Tabletop Simulator program given that it was eating too much of our time to update with every Set release. The cards will still be available to be imported there from this website, so nothing really changes on that area.
