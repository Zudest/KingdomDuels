A [small online browser based app](/deckbuilder/) is now available to help you plan your decks. It has filter options and the possibility to export and import the decks so you can edit them in the future. While not being able to export to Tabletop Simulator at the moment, i think it will be useful for testing ideas or making new decks. 

#### Features
- Filter by card name, code, card frame, duelist, types or set.
- Left Click on a card to add it to the corresponding Main Deck or Extra Deck (or Token Pile).
- Right Click on a card to zoom.
- Export your build to a .json file to save your changes in your own computer.
- Import the .json file for quick edits.
- Preview your combined Main Deck + Extra Deck.
- Save your deck to a textfile to use as a reference.
