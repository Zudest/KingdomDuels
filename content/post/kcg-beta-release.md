#### [KCG] Duelist Kingdom Card Game (Post #3) - Beta Release of the First Edition!

Hi guys! Sorry for the absence but i'm here to bring you a first release of a set of 102 cards for the card game that i'm working on.

If you don't know what i'm talking about, check [the first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2qdbv3/ive_been_working_on_a_yugioh_variant_card_game/) and [the second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2rjxxe/now_attack_the_moon_duelist_kingdom_inspired_card/).

This first iteration of cards cover from episode 1 up to episode 10 of the original series, including every card. You can check some **[examples here](http://imgur.com/a/TjUmm)**.

And you can DOWNLOAD .RAR with the 102 cards or check the [IMGUR](http://imgur.com/a/DZxcN) gallery.
