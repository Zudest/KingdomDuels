Heyo. It's been a while. 

I have a quick update on this project: __I'm working on it once again__. 

You may be wondering when is Set 3 going to drop? I commented on this in [another thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDuelistKingdom/comments/mfapgr/i_was_not_expecting_a_comment_on_the_steam_page/) yesterday but i'll post it here again for more visibility:

> **Q**: "Any words on when we might see a set 3?"
>
> **A**: If im going to be honest: I havent worked on Set 3 since december 2019. Even then i made some progress to it but i put it on hold shortly afterwards. 2020 was a weird year. There are some cards that were ready for that set that i can see from files dating back to february 2016 so... yeah.
>
> Im not putting any excuses here, i havent worked on it for a long time. That's the truth.
>
> That said i feel like I owe those that were ever interested in this project some closure, and seeing your TTS mod kinda revived my interest on this project. I updated a bit this subreddit yesterday, and im kinda thinking on starting a Discord and consolidating everything into a solid product that anyone can play in a Tabletop Simulator mod or in real life, like it was intended to originally.
>
> I won't set deadlines again, ill keep those to myself. But yes, Id like to finish this project so im going to work on it again.

So after that i went ahead and skimmed through my files and began working on it. No empty promises this time.

I updated this subreddit a bit and i have the intention on adding a new banner or something like that one of these days. 

I decided to double down on the commitment and made a small Discord Server in case there is interest on this project going forward. I'm not going to promote it too much until I have something to show though, so for now if any of you are interested on this you are free to join and chat.
