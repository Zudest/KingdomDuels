#### "Now! Attack the Moon!" - Duelist Kingdom inspired card game Post #2 - Cards, Rules, Duel sample and Quick Survey

Hi guys! I'm the guy that is making a card game based on the rules of the Duelist Kingdom ([this was the first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2qdbv3/ive_been_working_on_a_yugioh_variant_card_game/)). 

The Rules and Guide on how to play so far is posted in a comment below.

**IMGUR ALBUM**: http://imgur.com/a/VfPpf with the 12 Turns of the Duel between Mako and Yugi and every card used in this match.

Here I made a short 2-question survey about concerns that some of you posted in the past thread: **[TAKE THE SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VcBZXdtDq1Z0k9yAZgT1iuwE2xv_L3yTr40yPSsaMoQ/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Thanks for the support! :)
