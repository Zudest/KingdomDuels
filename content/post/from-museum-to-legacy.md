Hello Duelists! I wanted to make a quick blog post about some changes to the Yugioh Scrolls storyline.

## Museum Arc → Legacy Arc

This change has been in my mind for a while. I was never fully satisfied with the "Museum Arc" as a name for that portion of the story. Originally, I tried to have everything revolve around the Museum and... it was fine in some ways but in others it felt forced. Now that we are finishing the story of the whole chapter, i feel that it is better to make some name changes so the title flows better with the other arcs.

I'm renaming "Museum Arc" to "Legacy Arc" as i feel that it better reflects its core concepts: the legacy and the past of both the Other Yugi and Kaiba. In that arc we met people that had grudges or unresolved issues with them, and we explored both the modern and ancient past of those two characters in particular, so it make sense to give it a more fitting name.

- Rebecca wanted the Blue-Eyes back from Yugi's grandpa, and tells the story of how he got it.
- Otogi wanted to take revenge on Yugi for making Pegasus go off the grid after the Duelist Kingdom tournament.
- The Big Five trapped Kaiba and Mokuba in the virtual world, as they tried to take over his company from him.
- Noah and the Big Five joined forces to trap Yugi and friends so Kaiba was forced to rescue them.
- Within the virtual world we explored Kaiba's past, and even met Gozaburo who wanted revenge.
- Shadi tested both Yugi and the Pharaoh to see if they were worthy of their ancient past and power.
- Ishizu called Kaiba and told him about his ancient egyptian past.
- Anzu and the Other Yugi went to the Museum and met Ishizu who told them about his ancient egyptian past.

As you see, the main plot points of the whole arc, even if there are several mini-stories, always revolve around exploring a bit more of the past of both characters. While i tried to tie everything to the museum, in reality we spend more than half of the arc in either the virtual world or different places so it doesn't do it enough justice.

The story itself won't change, this is only to make room for a better presentation.
