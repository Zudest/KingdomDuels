**Rebirth of Avatar** is the new set released in Kingdom Duels on 2025-11-29.

#### Breakdown

- Codename: **[ROA]**
- It has **187 cards** from episodes [91 to 102](/story/wicked-arc/) of the Yugioh Scrolls project.
- It is focused around a modified adaptation of the spinoff "Yugioh R" manga, that retains the original concept but makes a couple of important changes. In here, Yako Tenma and his card professors capture Anzu, storm Kaiba Corporation building and lure Yugi to fight so they can gather enough duel energy to bring back Pegasus from a coma he's been since Duelist Kingdom. Iconic cards like The Wicked Gods make their debut here, alongside a lot of interesting cards that never got an official release in the TCG/OCG.
- New terrains: Indoors, Darkness.
- New card types: Bestial (Alter Monster Type).
- It provides support for the following duelists: Yako, Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Tilla Mook, Pete Coppermine, Kirk Dixon, Maico Kato, Gekko, Reiko Kitamori, Ted Banias, Scott Depre, Richie Merced, Keith, Willa Metta.
