You may be wondering what's going to happen next with the subreddit and this project. After releasing the 3rd and final set the KCG project is now officially finished and therefore no more development is planned for it. 

That said after seeing enthusiasm and knowing that this had potential to be something fun we decided to keep working on the idea, but starting from scratch. We are _rebooting_ this project taking everything we learned with KCG and expanding on it, going beyond the Duelist Kingdom Arc and asking ourselves the question: "what would have happened if the anime kept going with all these weird rules?"

We have a bunch of exciting things planned and a ton already in development. Also im not working alone anymore as i was in KCG so hopefully we can keep each other motivated and push some interesting concepts into a real life game that we can all play offline and hopefully online too.

This is the official end of the KCG project but the start of **Kingdom Duels**.
