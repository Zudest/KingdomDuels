#### Other Updates

- Check the recent [**Museum Arc Retrospective**](/post/retrospective-museum-arc/) where I expand a bit about how was the experience of designing cards and mechanics for the very first Story Arc after Duelist Kingdom.

- Check the recent [**Changes in Preparation for Battle City**](/post/adjustments-before-battle-city/) where we discuss about some important structural and quality of life changes that the game is receiving before we start with the Battle City Arc.

- Take a look at the tentative [rulebook](/rules-wip) with all the upcoming changes that we'll be rolling in the coming weeks.

- We updated our [Deckbuilder](/deckbuilder) with a lot of improvements on the search system. It works now with a syntax-based system (similar to Scryfall for Magic the Gathering).
