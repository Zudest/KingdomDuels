We are making some changes to the Terrain Markers, and we have two main things to talk about:

## Design

After more print-and-play testing and some feedback from the community it has become clear that the Terrains could use a small revamp. Having them in a square size, while serviceable for Tabletop Simulator and visually more cool for promotional material, has been a bit of a problem for actual physical play. Their odd size means that you can't really pack them into a deckbox and need to carry them separately.

So, we have been testing card-sized, horizontal, borderless terrains just like you can see in the image:

The text is centered so its easier to read. And now playing a card on top of them does not cover the actual effect if you place them a bit upwards. Honestly the main benefit is their new size, which is card-size like all other cards: being able to slot them in a regular deckbox instead of having to keep them separated was the main focus of this change.

These will be the new Terrain Markers going forward, and the previous square-sized Terrains will be replaced. We will be updating all promotional material and rulebook with the new images in the coming weeks.

## Field Power Bonus

Every Terrain will now have between 1 and 3 Monster Types that it gives Field Power Bonus. Previously there were some Terrains with 0 types, and some with 4 or more. 

We felt that having at least one type (except for the "Land" terrain which is the default) is a good way to reinforce the design of cards around this iconic mechanic from Duelist Kingdom. Also, having more than 3 was a bit more problematic to keep track and remember while playing, so this is a nice balance between the two options.
