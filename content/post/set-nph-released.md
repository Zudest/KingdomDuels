#### Yugioh Scrolls Updates

- The **[Characters](/scrolls/characters/)** page has been updated with preview images. In the future it will hold information about every single duelist in the project.
- The **[Setting](/scrolls/world/)** page has been updated with some information for the areas we already know. In the future a map will be added alongside more information of every relevant location in the yugioh scrolls project.
- The **[Timeline](/scrolls/timeline/)** has been updated with more clear information and markers for each Chapter and Arc.
- The **[Duels](/scrolls/duels/)** page will start being updated with character images shortly.


#### Expansion Sets

Previously we had four types of [Set Releases](/releases/) in mind for this game: *Core Sets*, *Story Sets*, *Expansion Sets* and *Illusory Sets*. Now, Expansion and Illusory will be combined into one for simplicity: "**Expansion Sets**".

The intention going forward is to double down on the ties between Yugioh Scrolls and Kingdom Duels regarding card releases, meaning that every single card in the Kingdom Duels project will be reflected somewhere within the Yugioh Scrolls project. Therefore, two new concept are introduced: *Duel Anecdotes* and *Duel Visions*.

- **Duel Anecdotes**: These are short self-contained stories that fit within the timeline and come up with new cards. They may tell encounters or events that we couldn't address during the regular "Chapter & Arc" story format or even explore different areas of the timeline that don't need a dedicated chapter.

- **Duel Visions**: These are illusions, visions of other universes and dimensions, weird realities colliding with each other. Basically it's an excuse to maybe in the future have a place to make crossovers between the Yugioh Scrolls project and other franchises. This is at the moment only theoretical but maybe in the future it could be interesting to explore so we are assigning it a proper place already so we cover all our bases.
