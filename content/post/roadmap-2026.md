Hello Duelists, i wanted to talk a bit about the future for Kingdom Duels. Personally, i've been moving quickly in 2025 and thus we saw a lot of new cards, more than ever before actually. We have specially picked up the pace a lot with the last few sets, and the current goal is to aim for a new set roughly every two months, hopefully.

Therefore, i wanted to make a tentative roadmap (subject to change) for the next year. It is a bit optimistic, as it reduces the time between sets even further than two months (not sure if its gonna be possible). But is honestly what i would like to aim for next year:

- **Q4 2025**:
    - ~~Set #6: Battle City part 2.~~
    - Set #7: Wicked Arc, part 1 (adaptation of Yugioh R).
    
- **Q1 2026**:
    - Set #8: Wicked Arc, part 2 (adaptation of Waking the Dragons).
    - Story Release: Millennium Chapter fifth arc.
    - Set #9: Final Arc, part 1.
    
- **Q2 2026**:
    - Set #10: Final Arc, part 2.
    - Story Release: King's Chapter first arc.
    - Set #11: King's Chapter, First Arc, part 1.
    - Set #12: King's Chapter, First Arc, part 2.

- **Q3 2026**:
    - Hiatus.

- **Q4 2026**:
    - (to be defined)

This means a couple of things. First of all, the first "Expansion Set" doesn't have a release date and will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. I want to focus more on the story sets, and given that the Expansion Set didn't gain a lot of traction i would like to revisit that concept again in the future with fresh ideas.

Also, i'll try to push hard until we get to set #12 because after that i will be taking a hiatus from new card releases entirely. The original idea had me going with each series in order (Millennium → King → Academy...) but that idea has changed and we will be releasing sets in a different pattern, more intertwined. But to do so, i will need to plan out every single storyline so it all make sense. Therefore, i need to focus on them for a while so i'll be stopping with the scheduled set releases at that point. 

This is all subject to change, but is an _optimistic_ view of next year.
